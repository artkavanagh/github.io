<h1>Back on Twitter</h1>
<h2>Maybe for good this time</h2>
<p>Towards the end of last year, I created a new Twitter profile after more than two years away. When I left, in September 2018, I deleted my account outright, so I had to start again from scratch. I had no followers, no tweets, no lists, no bookmarks and no likes. When I had been on Twitter before, from 2009 to 2018, I had ended up following a lot of people (well, about 350, which is more than twice Dunbar’s number), most of whom were tweeting things that didn’t interest me and that I rarely engaged with. I’ll explain below how that came about. But this time, I decided that I was going to be a lot more careful about whom I followed. And so far, that’s worked. Most of the items that show up in my timeline are things I find at least mildly interesting.</p>
<p>I had decided to rejoin Twitter as a kind of experiment, without expecting much from it. Last November, I started <a href="https://talkaboutbooks.substack.com/">a Substack newsletter</a>, and I thought Twitter might be useful as a source of potential readers. I was ready to delete my account quickly if it didn’t work out. Now, seven months in, it looks as if I’m planning to stay indefinitely. I recognized that fact when I read a post from Noah Smith’s newsletter (which I recommend), “<a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-terrific-triviality-of-twitter">The terrific triviality of Twitter</a>”. Smith’s analysis has convinced me that Twitter is a much less malign entity than it often seems.</p>
<blockquote>
Twitter outrage is like a summer squall — it strikes hard, but then moves on fast. That also means that there are many, many targets of outrage — far too many for any kind of organized or sustained boycott, except perhaps in one or two extreme cases.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
… it seems like only a matter of time before both people and corporations realize that Twitter mobs are largely paper tigers. Humans have never before lived in a society where everyone is getting yelled at all the time by strangers. But we’re in that society now, and we will eventually adapt to it.

<p>I first joined Twitter late in 2009, when I noticed that various jazz musicians, critics, journalists and listeners were tweeting #JazzLives whenever they attended a live performance, and I thought it might be fun to join them. At that point, I wasn’t totally committed to Twitter — I thought it likely that I’d delete or maybe just abandon my account eventually. There was a point in 2013 or 2014 where I didn’t tweet at all for a whole year. During that time, I was trying to write a “<a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction/AFB/AFB1-Selection.html">novel-length fiction</a>”. I eventually completed a draft of that and then spent the next year tweaking it and rewriting one chapter in full. By October 2015, I thought I’d done enough tweaking and that the time had come to try to find some readers. At that time, I was tweeting only very sporadically.</p>
<p>So, I Googled for some advice as to how to publicize a self-published work of fiction, and most of the advice I found put a lot of emphasis on social media, including Twitter. I was unconvinced, but I didn’t have any better ideas, so I followed the advice, and started to tweet regularly again, now using hashtags like #selfpub and #amwriting. Each such tweet got me at least a handful of new followers who were themselves tweeting the same hashtags. They too were self-published authors looking for readers. So, I ended up following and being followed by a few hundred people who were tweeting out links to ebooks and other writing that I wasn’t interested in, and who weren’t interested in reading mine. All it achieved was to fill up my timeline with irrelevant publicity. I suspected that many of these writers were actually muting most of the accounts that they appeared to be following, a kind of stealth-unfollowing.</p>
<p>But I stayed on Twitter, though I no longer saw it as an effective way of promoting my writing. During 2017 and 2018, I obsessively pored over <a href="https://twitter.com/sethabramson">Seth Abramson</a>’s epic tweetstorms, desperate to believe that Trump would somehow be stymied before he could determine the composition of the US Supreme Court for the next four decades.</p>
<p>Finally, though, in September 2018, I deleted my Twitter account. I didn’t even back it up first — something, incidentally, that I still have no regrets about: I’m never going to want to remind myself what, if anything, I was tweeting about in February 2013 or July 2011. I didn’t quit because I was fed up of all the pile-ons and trolling, the misogyny and racism. At least not consciously, though I had been horrified (and indeed shocked) by the hate campaign against Leslie Jones, following the Ghostbusters remake.</p>
<p>Really, I left because I didn’t think I was getting anything of value out of it. I wanted to try Manton Reece’s <a href="https://micro.blog/discover">Micro.blog</a> — where 280-character micro posts from people you are following are displayed in reverse-chronological order in a timeline — and I didn’t want to divide my attention between two very similar services.</p>
<p>I like Micro.blog a lot and have every intention of staying there. By design, it doesn’t have Likes or Retweets and it doesn’t display follower counts. So, it’s a lot less … tense. More relaxed, friendly.
But now, I’m happy to be on both Micro.blog and Twitter, notwithstanding their similarity. They’re about the only “social media” I still use: I’ve deleted Pinterest and <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/adios-Mix.html">deactivated Mix</a>. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
