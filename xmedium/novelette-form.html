<h1>Novelette: a suitable form for crime fiction?</h1>
<p>Until recently, I hadn’t heard the term “novelette” (or, if I had, it hadn’t stuck in my memory). <a href="http://annerallen.com/2018/06/novellas-novelettes-short-stories-flash/">Mara Purl slots it into the space</a> between a short story (upper limit 7,500 words) and a novella (lower limit 17,000) and other definitions that I’ve seen are similarly length-based, though the suggested word counts are slightly different. I did find an older definition according to which a novelette is generally “romantic” or light, and Purl herself notes that “novelettes are sometimes described as having trivial themes”.</p>
<p>Before I read Purl’s post, I had been thinking of my story “Protected” (which has a word count slightly below 9,500) as a <em>long</em> short story. It’s different from my other short stories in that it has a more involved plot than I’d have attempted in a shorter piece. It’s crime fiction. There’s no murder or body but there are allusions to a criminal trial (for conspiracy to murder) after which the narrator spends several years in witness protection. But that’s a bit of a smokescreen: the crimes that are actually being committed are for the most part less violent than conspiracy to murder.</p>
<p>So, is “novelette” a suitable form for a genre like crime fiction? I don’t think it matters what you call it: terms like <em>short story</em>, <em>novella</em> or <em>novel</em> tend to be applied after the fact to whatever it is that someone has written. As Purl says in her post, we’re seeing at the moment a trend towards shorter forms, including the short story and novella. This is partly because electronic publication (of one kind or another) allows for greater flexibility of form. I myself recently suggested that <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/uncollected-short-stories.html">the short story may benefit from having been freed from the former requirement that it resemble a chapter in a book</a>.</p>
<p>The story I’m working on at the moment, also crime fiction, will probably be affected by the trend towards the smaller form. I went back to it a few months ago after a gap of three or four years, to find that I had 49,000 words towards a first draft of a novel. Reading through it, though, I realized that I really didn’t like the subplot. It would need a lot of work, possibly a rethink from scratch. I’ve started to look at the possibility of excising the subplot in its entirety, along with two characters who might belong in a different story, and turning my planned novel into a novella instead.</p>
<p>In the end, I don’t think I’m going to label “Protected” a novelette. I still prefer to think of it as a long short story. If you’ve got 40 or so minutes to spare, maybe you can see what you think. The story is in five parts, <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction/protected-part-1">the first of which you’ll find here</a>.</p>
