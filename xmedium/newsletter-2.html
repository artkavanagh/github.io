<h1>More “Talk about books”</h1>
<h2>Issues 7 to 13 inclusive</h2>

<p>At the beginning of February I marked the first 6 issues (and first 10 weeks) of <a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/">Talk about books</a> with <a href="https://blog.artkavanagh.ie/talk-about-books-newsletter-b7af884a7253">a post on this site</a>. Since then, I’ve continued to send the newsletter out every two weeks (with a slight delay in the case of <cite>Midnight’s Children</cite>), so now the archive contains a further 7 issues. Recent topics include Tana French’s second novel (her first having featured in the 6th issue); another of “Empson’s insightful errors”, with a discussion of his interpretation of Joyce’s <cite>Ulysses</cite>; <cite>Midnight’s Children</cite> (which I seem to have described as “the most important English-language novel of the second half of the twentieth century”); the short stories of Roisín O’Donnell; and a handful of other books.</p>
<p>The 14th issue will focus on the third (and possibly the last) of Empson’s insightful errors: his idiosyncratic but illuminating reading of Marlowe’s <cite>Doctor Faustus</cite>. Over the next few months, I also hope to write about Michael Dibdin’s Aurelio Zen series, Scott Turow’s ambivalence about justice, and some of the plays of Thomas Middleton (either or both of <cite>A Fair Quarrel</cite> and <cite>A Game at Chess</cite>).</p>
<p>Here, in reverse chronological order, are direct links to the most recent 7 issues.</p>
<h3><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/morally-neutral-at-best-sally-rooneys">Morally neutral at best: Sally Rooney’s <cite>Conversations with Friends</cite></a></h3>
<p>Frances, the 21-year-old narrator of Sally Rooney’s first novel, <cite>Conversations with Friends</cite>, is not sure that she has a personality and, if she has, that she wants to examine it too closely.</p>
<h3><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/midnights-children-a-thousand-and"><cite>Midnight’s Children</cite>: “A thousand and one dead ends”</a></h3>
<p>The “most important English-language novel of the second half of the twentieth century” provides a cure for optimism.</p>
<h3><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/on-dover-beach-ian-mcewans-saturday">On “Dover Beach”: Ian McEwan’s <cite>Saturday</cite></a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/an-epical-forged-cheque-william-empson">An epical forged cheque: William Empson reads <cite>Ulysses</cite></a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/roisn-odonnell-wild-quiet">Roisín O'Donnell, <cite>Wild Quiet</cite></a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/tana-french-the-likeness">Tana French, <cite>The Likeness</cite></a></h3>
<p>A novel of doubles, reflections, parallels — and deceptive resemblance.</p>
<p>I’m thinking about creating a pdf version of each issue, past and future. I’d continue to send out the newsletter as an email every 2 weeks but the email would include a link to download the same text as a pdf. I’d be interested to hear whether readers would be interested in this option.</p>
<p>You can find the archive, and sign up to receive future issues by email, at <a href="https://www.letter.talkaboutbooks.net/">Talk about books</a>. I hope you’ll find something there that you’ll enjoy reading.</p>
