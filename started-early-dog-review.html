<h1>Kate Atkinson, <cite>Started Early, Took my Dog</cite></h1>
<p>The previous book in the series, <cite>When Will There Be Good News?</cite>, was so bleak that I must have been putting off reading this one, though it&#39;s nearly 5 years since I bought my copy. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t read it sooner. This is a multi-threaded story of lost, stolen, and trafficked children, of mothers killed, deliberately or recklessly, and of police who fail (sometimes culpably, sometimes not) to protect the vulnerable. One four-year-old, in particular, suffers an unimaginably horrible experience. Atkinson is a wonderful plotter and she weaves the strands of her tale into a solid fabric which leaves the reader not just satisfied but even, in spite of everything, a little bit hopeful.</p>
