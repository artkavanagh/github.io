# Introduction
 
## Welcome

Since January 2017, I’ve been posting most of my writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh). During that time, I’ve been giving priority to fiction, particularly shorter forms. I’ve also posted a couple of pieces of what I’ve been loosely calling literary criticism, though maybe just "criticism" would be a more accurate term. [Two of those](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/robert-galbraiths-cormoran-strike-books-7bd41682fbdc
) have been among [my most viewed](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/who-really-killed-the-generals-daughter-6d07a25b1e19) (and read) posts on the site, while the third, a rather specialist [discussion of one of Andrew Marvell’s satirical poems](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/the-paradoxical-ambition-of-andrew-marvells-third-advice-to-a-painter-1cdfae1018d2
), has been read all the way through by only one of its 27 visitors.



Apart from fiction and criticism, I’ve written an accidental series on the subject of aphantasia, since persuading myself in March or April of this year that I have that condition. (I’m using “condition” in the widest conceivable sense, as equivalent to “state”, and not to imply that aphantasia is a medical condition or impairment.)



### My Medium posts about aphantasia

These are the pieces I’ve posted on Medium since April 2018 in reverse chronological order:

- [Aphantasia and executive function](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-and-executive-function-c7a5cb05162c)
- [Aphantasia can look a bit like ADHD](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-can-look-a-bit-like-adhd-e81dc7e0e259)
- [Gender identity and aphantasia](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/gender-identity-and-aphantasia-e0c93850ffb1)
- [Anxiety, identity and self-image](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/anxiety-identity-and-self-image-40288046b46b)
- [Might aphantasia be learned behaviour?](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/might-aphantasia-be-learned-behaviour-47dc4c72026)
- [There is no Plan A](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/there-is-no-plan-a-e969c8f9587)
- [Aphantasia, memory and self-image](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-memory-and-self-image-2db66c17c5f3)
- [Aphantasia is not a disability](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-is-not-a-disability-511989fa1e71)
- [Straight &ldquo;A&rdquo;s](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/straight-a-s-a2b0b3bc8425)

Finally, there’s a post about autobiographical or episodic memory, and how I dealt with that subject in a short story before I knew I had aphantasia:

### Some of my short fiction on Medium

I&apos;ll be adding links to most of my fiction on Medium in the next few days. In the meantime, here&apos;s one to the first short story I finished, &ldquo;[Inheritance](https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/inheritance-cb80a3e59734)&rdquo;. I still think it&apos;s my best. Finally, this the shortest one I've written so far. I deleted it from Medium at the end of last year, so I'm posting it on this site. It&apos;s called &ldquo;[Closure](https://www.artkavanagh.ie/closure.md)&rdquo;
