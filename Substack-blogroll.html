<h1>Newsletters that I read (on Substack)</h1>

<p>Substack has been regularly adding new features and making the platform more useful to newsletter writers. In March, it added “<a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/new-homepage-links">Homepage links</a>”: the ability to include a column of links down the right-hand side of your newsletter’s archive page. The links can be to other newsletters or to anything else on the web, so an obvious potential use would be to create a blogroll. Last weekend, I tried that out with a short list of newsletters (all of them on Substack) that I read regularly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t work as well as I had hoped. The list of links runs down the right of the main column, rather than the right of the page, making the page look a bit cramped, and forcing long post titles to wrap rather than run across the width of the screen. I find the wrapped titles don’t stand out as well as I’d like, so I’ve removed my blogroll and, for now, I’m including the links on this page instead.</p>

<p>I started off with only six entries, to avoid overwhelming the reader with information overload. Here they are.</p>

<p><a href="https://helenlewis.substack.com">The Bluestocking</a> by Helen Lewis. Lewis is a staff writer for The Atlantic and author of the book <cite>Difficult Women</cite>.</p>

<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com">BIG by Matt Stoller</a>. A lot of detailed information about how monopolies govern so much of our lives, and what should be done about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://blgtylr.substack.com">sweater weather</a> by Brandon Taylor. Varied and often analytical newsletter from the author of the novel <cite>Real Life</cite> and short stories (<cite>Filthy Animals</cite>).</p>

<p><a href="https://commonreader.substack.com">The Common Reader</a> by Henry Oliver. Substantial essays on books and film, not all of which are recent.</p>

<p><a href="https://ellegriffin.substack.com">The Novellist</a> by Elle Griffin. Griffin is preparing to serialize her gothic novel via her Substack newsletter.</p>

<p><a href="https://mynewbandis.substack.com">My New Band Is</a> by Elizabeth Spiers. A “topically inconsistent” newsletter from a founding editor of Gawker.</p>

<p>It’s likely that I’ll add a few more as I discover them.</p>

<p>My main reason for wanting to include a blogroll was to help readers to find other newsletters they might find interesting. Here’s another suggestion:</p> 

<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="" data-author="Art Kavanagh" data-avatar="https://micro.blog/artkavanagh/avatar.jpg" cite="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog/2021/05/20/ive-noticed-a.html"><p>I’ve noticed a lot of Substack users asking how to find new writers or newsletters on the platform. I use Google, with <code>site:substack.com</code> added to my search term. For example</p>

<pre><code>"crime fiction" site:substack.com
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not foolproof but it can certainly be useful.</p>
