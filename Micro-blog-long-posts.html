<h1>My longer posts on Micro.blog</h1>

<p>I’ve been posting on Micro.blog since August 2018. As the name suggests, it’s a micro-blogging platform. Posts of 280 characters or less appear in their entirety in the timeline of anyone who is following you. You’re not limited to 280 characters, however. If a longer post has a title, that title will be displayed in the timeline, otherwise, the post will be truncated with a link to the full text. I tend to keep my posts to 280 characters or less (essentially using Micro.blog as <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2018/twitter-differences/">a friendlier alternative to Twitter</a>) but every now and then I post something longer. Because I buy blog hosting from Micro.blog (at $5 a month), <a href="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog">my posts on the platform constitute a regular blog</a>. Below, I list the more substantial pieces I’ve posted there that I think might, or should, have some longevity.</p>
