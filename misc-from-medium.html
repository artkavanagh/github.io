<h1>Miscellaneous posts that I moved from Medium</h1>
<p>During 2017 and 2018, I posted most of what I wrote — fiction, book discussion, a series of posts about aphantasia, and miscellaneous blog-style posts — on Medium. I’m about to delete my Medium account. Earlier this year, I moved to this site a baker’s dozen of miscellaneous pieces that I wanted to keep. I’ve listed them below in reverse chronological order with their date of first posting on Medium:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/AMarvell-poet.html">Andrew Marvell (1621–1678), poet</a>: Three essays [18-Nov-2019]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/Colm-T%C3%B3ib%C3%ADn-genre-fiction.html">What Colm Tóibín said about genre fiction</a> [25-Jul-2019]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/ebooks-not-real">Why ebooks aren’t real books</a> [09-Jun-2019]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/eluding-the-algorithm.html">Eluding the algorithm:</a> Web discovery in the aftermath of social media [11-May-2019]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/patience-a-virtue.html">Patience is a virtue I don’t have, unfortunately</a> [03-Mar-2019]<br>
Comparing the diametrically opposed approaches of Kim Liao and Kristine Kathryn Rusch to publishing fiction, and finding both wanting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/keyboard.html">On the keyboard</a> [18-Nov-2018]<br>
For a writer, the keyboard is the interface where the transfer takes place between your consciousness and the medium where your work is recorded in readable form. It’s the most important component of any computer you’ll ever use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/Sophie-Hannah-plans.html">Sophie Hannah plans her novels before she starts to write</a> [28-Oct-2018]<br>
The supposed plotter-pantser distinction is a false dichotomy. Everybody plans, even if they just plunge into writing without a moment’s reflection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/Goodreads-self-published-author.html">Goodreads and the self-published author</a> [24-Mar-2018]<br>
Goodreads may not be as welcoming an environment for the self-published author as many have assumed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/language-of-Ireland.html">The language of Ireland</a> [22-Jan-2017]<br>
The belief that the Irish language is capable of being revived has survived in an in-between state for decades: too weak to be put into effect, too entrenched to be given up. It’s time we stopped wasting resources on it.</p>
