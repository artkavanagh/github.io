<h1>Miscellaneous posts that I moved from Medium</h1>
<p>During 2017 and 2018, I posted most of what I wrote — fiction, book discussion, a series of posts about aphantasia, and miscellaneous blog-style posts — on Medium. I’m about to delete my Medium account. The first ten items shown below are ones that I posted to Medium this year (2021) when I was experimenting with using a custom domain name (blog.artkavanagh.ie). I’ve now ended that experiment and moved those posts to this site.
