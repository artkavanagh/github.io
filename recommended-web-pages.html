<h1>Blogs and personal websites that I like</h1>

<p>These are some blogs and personal sites that I visit regularly and that tend to be idiosyncratic, surprising or just good value. The list is a bit like a blog roll but I’m not going to call it that as I deliberately haven’t structured this site as a blog. The sites below aren’t the only ones I visit regularly. If a site has an RSS feed I’ll more than likely subscribe to that feed, unless I’m already following its owner on Micro.blog (in which case there’s usually no need to subscribe to the feed as well). I hope you’ll find something here that you find amusing, entertaining, informative or thought-provoking:</p>

<p><a href="https://indieseek.xyz/2018/10/24/decentralized-search-and-the-indieweb/">Brad Enslen</a><br/>
It’s become almost impossible to find what we’re looking for on the web, as opposed to what a marketer or advertising company thinks we should want. Brad Enslen argues that directories of sites and similar tools may be part of the answer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nicoledieker.com">Nicole Dieker</a><br/>
Dieker successfully self-published two volumes of literary fiction, <em>The Biographies of Ordinary People: Volume 1: 1989–2000</em> and <em>Volume 2: 2004–2016</em>. That’s a significant achievement — most successful self-publishers write in genres such as romance or science fiction — and Dieker documented the process in detail as she was going about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tedgioia.com">Ted Gioia</a><br/>
Gioia writes clearly and informatively about jazz and other kinds of music. He also writes penetratingly about fiction, including series of essays on such topics as “Conceptual Fiction”, “Postmodern Mystery” and “My Year of Horrible Reading”</p>

<p><a href="https://fvsch.com/">Florens Verschelde</a><br/>
Articles on web development and design, plus a few personal or political ones. I found this blog while looking for some simple CSS stylesheets that I could modify.</p>

<p><a href="https://jamesbooks.net/">James Book Blog</a><br/>
Reading recommendations in a variety of genres from a bookseller of long standing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.catrinadavies.co.uk/">Catrina Davies</a><br/>
Author of the forthcoming (July 2019) <cite>Homesick</cite>, about living in a shed. Her previous book was about busking solo from Norway to Portugal after her intended travel companion died.</p>

<p><a href="http://battellemedia.com/">John Battelle</a><br/>
Battelle wrote the book on <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292894/the-search-by-john-battelle/9781591841418/">Search</a>, and a lot more besides.</p>

<p>I’ll be adding more sites to this page as I find them, but I aim to do so <em>slowly</em>: i.e. to build up a useful resource over time rather than rush into compliling a long list of every site I can think of that readers just <em>might</em> possibly find interesting. I’ve delayed posting this page for a few weeks, feeling that I ought to wait until my list of recommendations is a bit more substantial but I’ve finally decided to post now and build up the list incrementally.</p>

<p>As of now, the list isn’t in any particular order. As it grows, I’ll think about splitting it into categories. I‘d encourage you to sign up for <a href="https://micro.blog/artkavanagh">Micro.blog</a> and see who I’m following there.</p>
