<h1>Writers on writing</h1>

<p>A week ago I posted <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-stories-online.html">a list of short stories that can be read online</a>. The list had its origin as Mix collection that is presumably no longer accessible because I’ve deactivated my Mix account. One of my other collections on Mix — the one that Mix itself recommended to new sign-ups — was “Writers on writing”. As that collection, too, has — or ought to have — disappeared with my account, I’ve extracted from it the links that seemed to me to be most worth keeping. Here they are:</p>

<blockquote>In comparison to making sculpture, the practice of writing is magnificently compact and easily dispersed. It allowed me to say precisely what I meant in a form understood by everybody. And yet, by the end of book two, I was so tired of my own voice and the things I had said and meant with it. I longed to silently make small objects that were concerned with form, feel and colour; that I could touch, hold and smell; that nobody else saw or cared about.</blockquote>

<p>Ben Dolnick, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/opinion/sunday/why-you-should-start-binge-reading-right-now.html">Why you should start binge-reading right now</a><br>
This is a writer on <em>reading</em>:</p>

<blockquote>To that point, I’d been reading the book the way I usually read books, which is to say in five- or 10-minute snatches before bed …</blockquote>

<blockquote>But in book after book, if you do push on through one chapter break, and then on through the chapter break after that, something amazing happens. Subplots that would once have been murky to the point of incomprehensibility (what was the deal with that dead sea captain again?) step into the light. Little jokes and echoes, separated by dozens or even hundreds of pages, come rustling out of the text forest. A writer’s voice — Grace Paley at her slangy best, Nicholson Baker at his hypomanic craziest — starts to seep into and color the voice of your innermost thoughts.</blockquote>

As a 17-year-old student about to go to college, Ottessa Moshfegh approached a famous male writer for advice. He was willing to give it — in exchange for veneration … and sex</p>

<blockquote>My ambition was not to be successful — to publish books and be renowned, rich and powerful, like Dicks; I wanted, truly, to use my writing to rise up to a higher realm of existence, away from the stupidity I saw in my classmates, teachers and parents, or on television and on the subway.</blockquote>

<p>Tim Parks, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/do-we-write-differently-on-a-screen">Do we write differently on a screen?</a></p>
<blockquote>You realize that the people reading what you have written will also be interrupted. They are also sitting at screens, with smartphones in their pockets … They won’t be drawn into the enchantment of the text. So should you change the way you write accordingly? Have you already changed, unwittingly?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dragging the story’s mechanics into the light became what I liked best about it, and made a strength of the problem that had for so long defeated me: where does the line between truth and fiction lie? …</blockquote>

<blockquote>Coming across someone else’s use of the same structure that had taken me months to arrive at would have been one thing. What really disturbed me, though, was that I had read the story, forgotten it, and then unwittingly plagiarized it.</blockquote>

<p>It’s quite a short list, as you see. I discarded many links to pieces that now seem more ephemeral or less significant than they did when I originally added them to the collection. Probably, I had been too liberal with my inclusions because I wanted to post to the collection regularly, and avoid the appearance of having stalled, or slipped into irrelevance. I hope you find something useful in what’s left.</p>
