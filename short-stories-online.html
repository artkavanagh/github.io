<h1>Short stories on the web</h1>
<p>Here is a list of short stories that can be read online, and that I recommend (some more wholeheartedly than others). I previously maintained this list as a collection on <a href="https://mix.com/">Mix</a> and as a board on Pinterest. I’ve deleted my Pinterest account and deactivated my Mix profile, so I thought it would be a good idea to recreate the collection/board as an ordinary web page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the comments I added to each link when I originally posted it have been lost. Mix seems to have done away with comments entirely, deleting the existing ones in the process (presumably because they were being used as a vehicle for spam). I was mistaken in thinking I had exported the Pinterest board as an RSS feed before deleting my account (as I did with some other boards). The feed would have contained my comments and pin descriptions, but unfortunately it doesn’t exist. As a result, many of the entries below are without descriptions or explanations as to why I think they're worth your while. In some cases, I’ve added new descriptions and I may well add more as and when I reread the stories.</p>
<h2>Most recent addition(s)</h2>

The title of this piece of flash fiction is the Irish for “change”. The narrator, Kate, has been back to Ireland for a family occasion and is met at O’Hare airport by her father, who is awkwardly uncomfortable about one change in particular. A lesson in how to talk around a subject without addressing it directly.</p>

<p>Mary Gaitskill, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/novellas/this-is-pleasure">This is pleasure</a>”<br>
Described as a novella, this 15,000-word story is narrated alternately by Margot and Quin, who have been friends for years. Quin is a senior editor in a publishing house and has believed “he could perceive people’s most essential nature just by looking at them” and that therefore he knew “what they would most respond to”. Unfortunately for him, younger women are less willing to play along with that ego-reinforcing kind of belief than their predecessors appeared to be.</p>

<p>Alan Glynn, “<a href="http://www.alanglynnbooks.com/stories/the-copyist-2">The copyist</a>”<br>
Imagine how different the world would be if John F Kennedy (1917–1963) had murdered John D Rockefeller (1839–1937) — in the 1870s. JFK is sent back in time and replaced in the Oval Office by a “copy”, with results that can’t be what <em>anybody</em> intended.</p>

</p>
<p>Mark Haddon, “<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/04/pier-falls-new-short-story-mark-haddon">The pier falls</a>”<br>
This realistic, documentary (yet fictional) account of the collapse of Brighton pier in July 1970 is a frighteningly believable description of a disaster that, for all we know, might easily have happened.</p>
<p>Sophie Hannah, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/20/the-tennis-church-sophie-hannah-short-story">The tennis church</a>”<br>

Dearbhaile Houston is working on a collection of short stories. In this one a woman dissects an unsatisfactory relationship and examines its entrails, before it has officially died.</p>
<p>Rosemary Jenkinson, “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-lost-generation-a-short-story-by-rosemary-jenkinson-1.4271992/">The lost generation</a>”<br>

Two women celebrate the award of funding for an antisuicide centre in a small town near Carrick-on-Shannon. But there isn’t a lot you can do to celebrate in a town like that other than drink. “Drunk and horny sort of went together for me”, says Grace, the narrator.</p>
<p>John Lanchester, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/signal-john-lanchester">Signal</a>”<br>
The narrator worries that one of the other guests spending New Year’s Eve at a country estate in Yorkshire, a very tall, cold (and rude) man, is taking a dangerous interest in his children. The tall man wanders around restlessly, speaking to nobody except the children, looking all the time at his phone. The host (the narrator’s friend from Cambridge, now stupendously rich) claims not to know who the tall man is, or even to have seen him. What does this mysterious figure want?</p>

</p>
<p>Ottessa Moshfegh, “<a href="http://www.barcelonareview.com/92/e_om.html">The surrogate</a>”<br>
A 28-year-old woman with a model’s looks takes on the role of titular vice president of a business she doesn’t understand. She is the front woman for an enterprise owned and run by Lao Ting, who believes that his American customers would be happier to deal with a young, blue-eyed, Christie Brinkley lookalike than with him. Lao Ting appears to be a conman, but the narrator’s real problems lie somewhere else entirely.</p>
<p>Louise Nealon, “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/you-ve-read-cat-person-now-read-this-irish-bad-sex-short-story-1.3363992">What feminism is</a>”<br>
This story won the Seán Ó Faoláin competition in 2017. A young woman, a student and writer, feels competitive with other young women, also writers, who (like her) have had sex with the male coeditor of a college literary magazine. The <cite>Irish Times</cite> headline on the story is “You've read Cat Person, now read this Irish bad-sex short story”
but the comparison could lead readers to expect the wrong things from this story. There are superficial similarities, of course — male sex partner behaving badly, for a start.</p>
<p>Alissa Nutting, “<a href="https://lithub.com/models-assistant">Model’s assistant</a>”<br>
A woman, in her 30s but still “always the nerd at the party”, drifts into the unpaid but lucrative role of model’s assistant when the model, who is “from somewhere Swedishy” but almost certainly not Sweden, hands her a crystal-encrusted phone and, four days later, calls her on it. From Nutting’s collection <cite>Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls</cite>.</p>
<p>Frank O’Connor, “<a href="http://www.cyc-net.org/cyc-online/cycol-0201-oconnor.html">My Oedipus complex</a>”</p>
<p>Nuala O’Connor, “<a href="http://newflashfiction.com/nuala-oconnor">Birdie</a>”</p>
<p>Roisín O’Donnell, “<a href="https://www.writing.ie/special-guests/how-to-build-a-space-rocket-writing-ie-short-story-of-the-year-2018">How to build a space rocket</a>”<br>
It was only when I was putting this list into alphabetical order that I noticed that O’Donnell seems to have a liking for “How to …” titles. This story is told from the point of view of seven-year-old Keshika, finding it difficult to interpret the behaviour of her parents (who are about to “take a break” from each other) while trying to make a rocket with red phosphorous matches and aluminium foil.</p>
<p>Roisín O’Donnell, “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/how-to-learn-irish-in-seventeen-steps-by-rois%C3%ADn-o-donnell-1.2659288">How to learn Irish in seventeen steps</a>”<br>
A story from O’Donnell’s extraordinary collection <cite>Wild Quiet</cite>. A Brazilian woman marries an Irish musician and follows him when he goes back to Ireland, where she registers as a teacher. Her registration is conditional on her learning the Irish language within three years.</p>
<p>Helen Oyeyemi, “<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/fiction/2016/03/interesting-about-e-and-new-short-story-helen-oyeyemi">Interesting about E and A</a>”<br>
The friendship between two obscure Brontë scholars comes under strain when one of them receives some minor recognition. The narrator only ever refers to  the slightly more successful scholar as “my best friend”. They speculate about an apparent reference found in a letter, and about the letter’s author, and about the parallels between their own relationship and that between the two youngest Brontë siblings.</p>

A couple who don’t yet know each other very well go on a four-day hike on Exmoor, where they encounter danger.</p>

</p>
<p>Sally Rooney, “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/mr-salary-a-short-story-by-sally-rooney-1.3016223">Mr Salary</a>”<br>
This is the first thing by Sally Rooney that I read, and I’m very glad if was. I discuss this and two other stories by her (including the previous item on this list) in “<a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Sally-Rooney-short-stories.html">Oh my god, shut up”: Sally Rooney, short story writer</a>.</p>
<p>Adam Roberts, “<a href="https://medium.com/adams-notebook/story-earth-versus-the-heliists-1dd00018dfc3">Earth versus the Heliists</a>”<br>
A flash fiction story from the author of <cite>The Thing Itself</cite> and <cite>Purgatory Mount</cite> (the second of which is just out in paperback): the inhabitants of Earth survive and see off the unimaginably superior forces of the Sun.</p>
<p>Salman Rushdie, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/18/in-the-south">In the South</a>”<br>
</p>
<p>Salman Rushdie, “<a href="https://salmanrushdie.substack.com/p/the-lender-of-time">The lender of time</a>”<br>
A new short story by Rushdie, posted on his Substack newsletter (where he’s also serializing a short new novel for paying subscribers). Whimsical, perhaps would-be Borgesian and undoubtedly timey-wimey, it features a (temporary) visitor from The Furthest Galaxy Known To Man (FGKTM).</p>

<p>Madhuri Vijay, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/17/you-are-my-dear-friend/">You are my dear friend</a>”<br>
A thirtyish former au pair marries a much older man and adopts an 8-year-old girl from an impoverished background.</p>
<p>Kit de Waal, “<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/exterior-paint-a-short-story-by-kit-de-waal-1.3179430">Exterior paint</a>”<br>
Alfonse, originally from St Kitts, but who has lived in Marshall Street, Smethwick since the 60s, prepares to sell his house following the death of his wife, Lillian, and remembers their courtship, the racism of Lillian’s mother — and the visit of Malcolm X to their English midlands street, just 9 days before his murder.</p>
<p>Charmaine Wilkerson, “<a href="https://www.reflexfiction.com/anger-management-flash-fiction-by-charmaine-wilkerson">Anger management</a>”<br>
Winner of the Reflex Fiction quarterly international flash fiction competition for Winter 2017, this story contains a wealth of emotion, observed detail, metaphor, regret and (as the title suggests) anger in a very short length.</p>
<p>This page will probably be updated from time to time, as I find more short stories worth reading online or add descriptions or comments to the stories above that don’t already have them.</p>
