<h1>J P Delaney, <cite>The Girl Before</cite> review</h1>
<p>Despite a preposterously contrived setup this is a lot of fun, with a meticulously constructed plot, and a variety of characters who are obsessive and/or narcissistic yet curiously appealing. Three years apart, two very different women, with a strong physical resemblance to each other and to the architect/landlord’s dead wife, take on the tenancy of an austere, high tech house in North London. There are stringent conditions: for a start no floor coverings, curtains or bookshelves are allowed. The first woman, Emma, craves security after a burglary at her previous home, while her successor, Jane, is grief-stricken after a stillbirth. The house promises to keep them safe … until the moment it turns against them. According to the acknowledgements, the author spent 10 years working out how to write the book, and it shows.</p>
