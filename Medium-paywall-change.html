<h1>Medium’s paywall — a change of approach</h1>

<p>After I registered my .ie domain name and set up a static site, I found myself wondering <a href="https://medium.com/p/895e0c3ecad5">what I should post here and what on Medium</a>. I think the answer might be becoming clearer. A few days ago I remarked that <a href="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog/2019/05/08/my-two-most.html">my two most recent stories on Medium had performed disappointingly</a> in terms of the number of readers they attracted. I changed one of the tags on both stories from “Literary Criticism” to <a href="https://medium.com/tag/book-discussion">Book Discussion</a>. That hasn’t, as yet made any noticeable difference.</p>

<p>However, I spotted something new on the analytics page for the affected posts: a note to the effect that these stories were “Not distributed in topics”. A click on the question mark beside this note revealed:</p>

<blockquote>
Our curators were not able to review this story for distribution in topics due to high volume. This story will still be shared with followers.
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t look any further into that at the time but today I posted <a href="https://medium.com/p/5fd3d457923c">a more recent story on Medium</a> and I got the notice that’s been appearing recently (and which I’ve been ignoring) which says the story is eligible for the metered paywall. So I followed the <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018834314">Learn more</a> link and discovered that Medium has made changes to the way that stories are recommended.</p>

<blockquote>
Stories that are part of the paywall are also eligible for distribution to Medium readers through topics, which power recommendations on Medium on our home page, our topic pages, in our Daily Digest, and in our apps …</blockquote>

<blockqote>Stories that are not eligible to be part of the paywall will only be distributed to your followers …
</blockquote>

<p>Did you notice the ambiguity here? Stories that are part of the paywall are eligible for distribution through topics, i.e. for recommendation by curators, which will mean exposure to a much larger number of potential readers. On the other hand, stories that are <em>not eligible to be part of the paywall</em> will be shown only to the author’s followers. That leaves a third category: stories which, though <em>eligible</em> to be part of the paywall, are not in fact part of it because the authors have chosen not to include them. Might these stories be included in topics even though not in the paywall? Reading between the lines, I deduce that it’s technically possible that such stories may be added to topics but that this will happen only when there isn’t a high volume of paywalled stories, i.e. once in a blue moon.</p>

<p>My first thought on reading this was “Uh-oh, I’ve got to choose between restricting access to my posts on the one hand, and not getting any benefit in terms of visibility on the other”. If it were as simple as that, the choice would be a no-brainer: so long, Medium, it’s been fun. But it’s not as simple as that.</p>

<p>First, not all stories included in the paywall will necessarily be restricted for all readers:</p>

<blockquote>
For all posts that are eligible to be metered, Medium will choose whether or not to meter a particular reader when they view that post based on a number of factors. So some users may not see the paywall on your story …
</blockquote>

<p>In short, Medium will have discretion to determine (on the basis of game theory and data-driven psychology, no doubt) exactly the best moment to hit a reader with the “subscribe to read more” notice. But then there’s the “friend link”, which can be shared with friends (obviously) but also “through any social media platform”:</p>

<blockquote>
We make this link available to writers so that they can share a “meter-free” version of their story with their friends and followers on social media.
</blockquote>

<p>I’m no longer on either Facebook or Twitter, but it seems clear to me that Micro.blog and Mix, not to mention Pinterest, are included in “social media” for this purpose and that it’s permissible to post friend links there. In other words, this change on Medium’s part is not quite as drastic as it seems at first glance.</p> 

<p>While I started this post with the intention of announcing my departure from Medium, I’ve ended up in a somewhat different place. I’m going to stay for the time being and see how things develop from here. I’ve just gone back to the two stories whose poor viewing statistics were the starting point for this post, and checked the boxes that permit the curators to add them to topics. I’ll be posting the friend links on Micro.blog once I’ve got them.</p>
