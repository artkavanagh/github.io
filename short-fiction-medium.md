# Short fiction on Medium — recommendations

Between June 2017 and August 2018, I had a weekly newsletter with the title “Recommended Short Fiction on Medium”. After a little over a year, I allowed it to peter out, for a number of reasons. First, I was unenthusiastic about the email format from the start and was using it partly to disprove a point. I’d read lots of advice to struggling authors, telling us that the most important task before us was to build an email list and that the way to do that is to send out an email newsletter. I didn’t want it to be true that, after 25 years of the web, the best way to connect with a readership was via the near-stone-age technology of email. (Counterintuitive though it might seem, the people of 1993 are temporally and technologically much closer to the stone age than they are to us.) You could say that I set out to fail. (It certainly wouldn’t be the first time.)

Just to be sure of evading success, I made unnecessary but tiresome rules. At first I tried to recommend different authors every week, without repeating anybody. But there were some authors who were both prolific and excellent writers, so I had to relax this rule within weeks. I decided I’d allow each author to appear in _no more than two_ issues of the newsletter. Initially, I’d hoped to recommend only stories that weren’t restricted to members only, since it seemed unlikely that many subscribers to the newsletter would also have taken out paid Medium memberships. That limitation turned out to be almost impossible to comply with, so instead I resolved to recommend no more than one members-only story a week. Towards the end, I had to abandon that rule entirely.

While I’m relieved to be shot of the newsletter, I’m still very fond of the title and I’d hate to see it fall into complete disuse. There’s still a collection on Mix labeled “[Short fiction on Medium](https://mix.com/artkavanagh/short-fiction-on-medium)” where I used to post links to each week’s recommendations just after I’d sent out the newsletters. I intend to continue to post links to recommended stories in this collection but I haven’t added any since the newsletter ended. I’m going to do something about that within the next few days.

Additionally, whenever I add a new story recommendation to the Mix collection, I’ll simultaneously post it to my [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/artkavanagh) and add a link to a page on this site. I’m hopeful that Recommended Short Fiction on Medium can still be revived, just not as a newsletter.

You can find previous recommendations (these stories don’t go out of date) in that Mix collection or on these pages:

Earlier today, I was writing a post in which I argued that [subscription services are a much better option than ebooks](https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-subscription) for authors who’d like to make some money from their work, and that Medium is, in effect, the best subscription service available to self-publishing authors. This being so, it naturally struck me that I ought to revert to doing my bit to promote and encourage fiction writers to post their work on Medium. So here goes.
