<h1>Talk about books</h1>

<h2>A new newsletter</h2>

<p>This site has just passed its second birthday: last week I renewed the domain name registration for a third year. I started the site in December 2018 as somewhere to put the kind of writing that I had previously been posting on Medium.</p>

<p>And now I’ve just started a fortnightly newsletter on Substack. It’s called <a href="https://talkaboutbooks.substack.com">Talk about books</a>. In it, I’m aiming at a discussion of books, stories and other writing (mainly fiction) that goes into a bit more depth than the average book review. Ideally, the works I’ll be discussing will be ones that the reader, too, has read, so there’ll be no avoidance of so-called spoilers. If you’d like an idea of the kind of thing I intend to include, take a look at the <a href="#bookdiscuss">book discussion</a> that I’ve previously posted on this site.</p>

<p>I’m at the halfway point between the second issue (about <a href="https://talkaboutbooks.substack.com/p/dervla-mctiernans-female-characters">female characters in two crime novels by Dervla McTiernan</a>) and the third (which, unless something unexpected happens in the next week, will be about reading <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite> as an aphantasic.</p>
	
<h2>My posts about aphantasia</h2>

<p>Apart from fiction and criticism, I’ve written an accidental series on the subject of aphantasia, since recognizing in March or April 2018 that I have that condition. (I’m using “condition” in the a wide sense, as equivalent to “state”, and not to imply that aphantasia is a medical condition or impairment.) Up to January 2019, I published those posts on Medium, More recent posts are on this site</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts">the list of posts so far</a> &mdash; I&apos;ll update it if and when I add more.</p>

<h2>My fiction on Medium</h2>

<p>I’ve made <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list">a list of my own stories</a>. These were all previously posted on Medium but with one remaining exception can now be read on this site. The list includes several short stories, a novella and a novel, all of which are free to read. As a bonus, here is the shortest story I&apos;ve written so far, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Closure">Closure</a>&rdquo;. It comes in at about 750 words. I originally posted it on Medium but deleted it last year and now I&apos;ve reposted it here.</p>

<h2>Former Mix collections</h2>

<p>There were two Mix collections that I was quite sorry to leave behind when <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/adios-Mix.html">I deactivated my Mix account</a>, so I decided to recreate them here, in so far as I could. I’ll update them as the mood takes me and/or I find more short stories online, or posts about writing by writers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writers-on-writing.html">Writers on writing</a><br>
A list of pieces available to read on the web in which writers discuss aspects of the craft, process or experience of writing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-stories-online.html">Short stories on the web</a><br>
A list of short stories that you can read online. I previously maintained the list as Pinterest board as well as as a Mix collection. It should work just as well as a regular web page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/judgment-of-critics.html">The judgment of critics</a><br>
For most of my life I’ve believed that the paramount function of the critic was judgment. Then John Naughton (Memex 1.1) quoted a short, simple epigram from Robert Musil that changed my mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/who-needs-independent-booksellers.html">Who needs independent booksellers?</a><br>
It’s not easy to be consistent in one’s attitude to booksellers, whether independent or part of a chain, particularly when one thinks about how Amazon has changed the market for books in the past 15 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/books-left-behind.html">The books I left behind — and some I didn’t</a><br>
Nine years ago, I left most of my books, as well as a substantial portion of my other possessions, in the attic of my sister’s house near Toulouse. I’ve just been back to sort out which of the books I want to keep.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/whither-RSS.html">Where to now for RSS?</a><br>
It’s nice to be using RSS again but I still have some reservations about it. Here are my suggestions for incorporating its most essential features into HTML and the browser.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/even-plainer-text.html">Even plainer text</a><br>
A suggestion for writing a basically structured document in plain (i.e. UTF-8) text without reference to an external style sheet and with as little markup as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/body-in-the-matrix.html">The body in <cite>The Matrix</cite></a><br>
I watched <cite>The Matrix</cite> only once, and didn’t like it, to the extent that I didn’t bother to watch the sequels. A piece in <cite>Vox</cite> by Emily VanDerWerff about the film as an allegory of gender transition has made me realize why I’ve been refusing the red pill. It has to do with transcending the body’s limitations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/poetry-scholarly-editions.html">Reading poetry in scholarly editions</a><br>
Scholarly editions of poetry provide some protection against anachronistic readings, misinterpretation and other errors. Unfortunately, that protection comes at a price.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/gender-as-behaviour.html">A good masculinity is hard to find</a>: Part 3 — gender as behaviour</br>
The old-fashioned notion of gender-as-behaviour has recently been overshadowed by the concept of gender identity. But there are still useful things to be said about the older idea. For one thing, having believed for more than 35 years that masculinity and femininity were “merely social constructs”, I’ve recently changed my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="bookdiscuss">Criticism and book discussion</h2>

<p>This section is for links to my writing about other writing — in particular fiction, poetry and (conceivably, eventually) drama. At the moment, I’m for the most part alternating between two projects. The first is to turn my doctoral thesis (“Andrew Marvell’s ambivalence about justice”) into something more widely accessible; the second to examine how some authors have been able to maintain interest in the same or connected characters over a series of crime fiction novels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Prelate.html">“Prelate of the grove”: A note on ambition and preferment in Marvell’s “Upon Appleton House”</a><br>
The treatment of ambition and preferment in Andrew Marvell’s “Upon Appleton House” indicates the need to develop an acutely discriminating conscience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Sally-Rooney-short-stories.html">“Oh my god, shut up”: Sally Rooney, short story writer</a><br>
Before she was an acclaimed novelist, Sally Rooney was already a very impressive short story writer. Here, I discuss three of her stories which can be read on the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/religion-theodicy.html">“What course and opinion he thinks the safest”: Religion and divine justice in the work of Andrew Marvell</a><br>
A by-product of my thesis, which was about justice as a theme in Marvell’s works. That topic was suggested to me by a book about his treatment of <em>divine</em> justice but I found that Marvell’s writings about divine justice engaged with theodicy only incidentally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ishiguro-never-let-me-go.html">Kazuo Ishiguro, <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite></a><br>
Restrained and understated it may be. but when you look closely Kazuo Ishiguro’s sixth novel is a horror story.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Robert-Galbraith-Lethal-White.html">Robert Galbraith, <cite>Lethal White</cite></a><br />
Nearly 18 months ago, I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/p/7bd41682fbdc">a post on Medium</a> in which I argued that each of the first three Cormoran Strike novels explores a different trope or sub-genre of crime fiction. Now, at long last, I’ve added my thoughts on the fourth novel in Robert Galbraith’s series.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/skin-deep.html">Liz Nugent, <cite>Skin Deep</cite></a><br />
I previously wrote a mini-review of Liz Nugent’s <cite>Lying in Wait</cite> which you can find on <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/book-reviews.html">the book reviews page</a>. Here‘s a slightly more substantial discussion of her more recent novel.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Marvell-gender.html">Andrew Marvell’s Gender</a><br />
This is an essay that I published in <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1093/escrit/cgw006"><cite>Essays in Criticism</cite></a> in 2016. As the title suggests, it looks at how gender informs Andrew Marvell’s writing. The version I’ve posted here is a HTML conversion of the approved draft. The final, definitive version is on <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1093/escrit/cgw006">the journal’s website</a>. That’s the version that should be cited, of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/overkills-deceptive-attraction-852b5b04843f">Gillian Flynn&apos;s plotting in <cite>Dark Places</cite>: The deceptive attraction of overkill</a><br />
My discussion of the plot of Gillian Flynn&apos;s second novel, <cite>Dark Places</cite> (2009).</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/rereading-kate-atkinsons-behind-the-scenes-at-the-museum-7e4635c9cc30">Rereading Kate Atkinson&apos;s <cite>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</cite></a><br />
Kate Atkinson’s first novel has a narrator who falls into three different types, each pulling in different directions. This results in a “teeming”, overstuffed tale whose profusion of detail tends to compensate for or distract from a glaring gap in the narrator’s memory. It’s a novel that requires to be reread.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/finite-though-unbounded">Finite though unbounded: the abolition of infinity in the poetry of William Empson</a><br/>
A long essay (originally 5,000 words, but it seems to have stretched a bit over the years) about a theme in the early poetry of William Empson, which I wrote in 1996 and now think is worth resurrecting in a very slightly revised form. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Paradoxical-ambition.html">The paradoxical ambition of Andrew Marvell’s <cite>Third Advice to a Painter</cite></a><br/>
This is an argument (really a by-product of my thesis) about one of Marvell’s satires.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/p/6d07a25b1e19/">Who really killed The General’s Daughter?</a><br/>
A discussion of the resolution of the plot of Nelson DeMille’s 1992 novel <cite>The General’s Daughter</cite>.</p>

This post deals with tropes and subgenres in the first three Cormoran Strike books. For <cite>Lethal White</cite>, see above.</p>

<h2>Book reviews</h2>

<p>Most of the <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/book-reviews">book reviews from Goodreads</a> that I think are worth keeping have now been moved to this site.</p>

<h2>Micro.blog</h2>

<p><a href="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog">I use Micro.blog</a> mainly as an alternative to Twitter but from time to time I post longer pieces there. Here is <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Micro-blog-long-posts.html">a list of some of my longer posts</a> which I don’t necessarily want to see buried in the timeline.</p>
