<h1>Talk about books</h1>

<h2>A new newsletter</h2>

<p>This site has just passed its third birthday: last month I renewed the domain name registration for a fourth year. I started the site in December 2018 as somewhere to put the kind of writing that I had previously been posting on Medium.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago I started a fortnightly newsletter on Substack. (Now, two issues into its second year, I’m moving it to Micro.blog.) It’s called <a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/subscribe">Talk about books</a>. In it, I’m aiming at a discussion of books, stories and other writing (mainly fiction) that goes into a bit more depth than the average book review. Ideally, the works I’ll be discussing will be ones that the reader, too, has read, so there’ll be no avoidance of so-called spoilers. If you’d like an idea of the kind of thing I intend to include, take a look at the <a href="#bookdiscuss">book discussion</a> that I’ve previously posted on this site.</p>

<p>I’ve now sent out 28 issues of the newsletter, dealing with such topics as William Empson’s insightful errors, Ian McEwan’s novel <cite>Saturday</cite> (2005) complicated plotting (in more than one sense) in Sarah Waters’s <cite>Fingersmith</cite> and Wilkie Collins’s <cite>Armadale</cite> and Tana French’s first two novels.</p>

<p>Though my newsletter is moving from Subtack, I’m still a fan of the platform, and regularly read several newsletters there, some by email but many in RSS. Here’s a list of <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Substack-blogroll.html">a few of my particular favourites</a>.</p>
	
<h2>My posts about aphantasia</h2>

<p>Apart from fiction and criticism, I’ve written an accidental series on the subject of aphantasia, since recognizing in March or April 2018 that I have that condition. (I’m using “condition” in the a wide sense, as equivalent to “state”, and not to imply that aphantasia is a medical condition or impairment.) Up to January 2019, I published those posts on Medium, More recent posts are on this site</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts">the list of posts so far</a> &mdash; I&apos;ll update it if and when I add more.</p>

<h2>Fiction by me</h2>

<p>I’ve made <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list">a list of my own stories</a>. These were all previously posted on Medium but with one remaining exception can now be read on this site. The list includes several short stories, a novella and a novel, all of which are free to read. As a bonus, here is the shortest story I&apos;ve written so far, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Closure">Closure</a>&rdquo;. It comes in at about 750 words. I originally posted it on Medium but deleted it last year and now I&apos;ve reposted it here.</p>

<h2>Former Mix collections</h2>

<p>There were two Mix collections that I was quite sorry to leave behind when <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/adios-Mix.html">I deactivated my Mix account</a>, so I decided to recreate them here, in so far as I could. I’ll update them as the mood takes me and/or I find more short stories online, or posts about writing by writers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writers-on-writing.html">Writers on writing</a><br>
A list of pieces available to read on the web in which writers discuss aspects of the craft, process or experience of writing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-stories-online.html">Short stories on the web</a><br>
A list of short stories that you can read online. I previously maintained the list as Pinterest board as well as as a Mix collection. It should work just as well as a regular web page.</p>

<h2>Recent posts</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/copper-book-app.html">Up to a point, with Copper</a><br>
I’ve signed up for yet another book/reading tracking app: Copper. This time it might be different. The app, which is iOS-only for now, aims at a more even balance between the interests of authors and readers than comparable apps have done before now.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-year2.html">“Talk about books” newsletter — year 2, first quarter</a><br>
Talk about books is now seven issues into its second year. Here’s a summary of the year so far, and an indication what to expect in the next few months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/micro-blog-description-hugo.html">Adding a description to Micro.blog posts</a><br>
I wanted to add a description to my newsletter posts in Micro.blog, one that could be used in Twitter cards and in an archive of (only) the posts included in the newsletter (Talk about books). This is how I did it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/substack-farewell.html">Substack farewell: “Talk about books” is moving</a><br>
I had no intention of moving “Talk about books” from Substack. Then Manton Reece introduced email newsletters on Micro.blog. The decision to move my newsletter was far from being a no-brainer but it didn’t take me long to make up my mind. Here, I explain why.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Literal-not-for-me.html">Literal.club is an interesting app/site, but it’s not for me</a><br>
Why I decided to stop using Literal.club: I don’t need an alternative to Goodreads. I’m happier when I’m <em>not</em> keeping track of my reading.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Literal-reviews.html">Three book reviews that I posted on Literal.club</a><br>
I tried out Literal.club for two months but concluded it wasn’t for me. Here are three reviews I posted there of books I haven’t written about elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-print-edition">Talk about books — print edition</a><br>
My newsletter, Talk about books, is a year old now. I think it’s time that it existed in print as well as in the form of bytes and data.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-year-already.html">A year of “Talk about books” (already)</a><br>
It’s hard to believe, but my newsletter, “Talk about books”, has been running for a year already. The first issue of year 2 is due on 24 November.</p>

<h2 id="bookdiscuss">Criticism and book discussion</h2>

<p>This section is for links to my writing about other writing — in particular fiction, poetry and (conceivably, eventually) drama. At the moment, I’m for the most part alternating between two projects. The first is to turn my doctoral thesis (“Andrew Marvell’s ambivalence about justice”) into something more widely accessible; the second to examine how some authors have been able to maintain interest in the same or connected characters over a series of crime fiction novels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/rereading-atkinson-museum.html">Rereading Kate Atkinson&apos;s <cite>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</cite></a><br />
Kate Atkinson’s first novel has a narrator who falls into three different types, each pulling in different directions. This results in a “teeming”, overstuffed tale whose profusion of detail tends to compensate for or distract from a glaring gap in the narrator’s memory. It’s a novel that requires to be reread.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/atwood-handmaid-tale.html">Margaret Atwood, <cite>The Handmaid’s Tale</cite> (1985)</a><br />
Till <a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/margaret-atwood-the-handmaids-tale">recently</a>, I had never reread <cite>The Handmaid’s Tale</cite>, having first read it more than 30 years ago. I don’t think I was fair to it then: it was clearly time to give it another chance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/who-killed-generals-daughter.html">Who really killed The General’s Daughter?</a><br/>
A discussion of the resolution of the plot of Nelson DeMille’s 1992 novel <cite>The General’s Daughter</cite>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/finite-though-unbounded">Finite though unbounded: the abolition of infinity in the poetry of William Empson</a><br/>
A long essay (originally 5,000 words, but it seems to have stretched a bit over the years) about a theme in the early poetry of William Empson, which I wrote in 1996 and now think is worth resurrecting in a very slightly revised form. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/overkill-deceptive-attraction.html">Gillian Flynn&apos;s plotting in <cite>Dark Places</cite>: The deceptive attraction of overkill</a><br />
My discussion of the plot of Gillian Flynn&apos;s second novel, <cite>Dark Places</cite> (2009).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/galbraith-cormoran-strike-books.html">Robert Galbraith’s Cormoran Strike books</a><br/>
This post deals with tropes and subgenres in the first three Cormoran Strike books. For <cite>Lethal White</cite>, see next item.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Robert-Galbraith-Lethal-White.html">Robert Galbraith, <cite>Lethal White</cite></a><br />
Nearly 18 months ago, I wrote <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/galbraith-cormoran-strike-books.html">a post (originally on Medium)</a> in which I argued that each of the first three Cormoran Strike novels explores a different trope or sub-genre of crime fiction. Now, at long last, I’ve added my thoughts on the fourth novel in Robert Galbraith’s series.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ishiguro-never-let-me-go.html">Kazuo Ishiguro, <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite></a><br>
Restrained and understated it may be. but when you look closely Kazuo Ishiguro’s sixth novel is a horror story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/kerr-philosophical-investigation.html">‘What is conceivable can happen too’: Philip Kerr, <cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite> (1992)</a><br>
Philip Kerr’s early novel, A Philosophical Investigation, is nearly as much a mystery to me now as it was almost 30 years ago. That’s fine: it’s meant to be a mystery.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/faustus-plagued-in-hell.html">“Still to be plagued in hell”: Christopher Ricks and William Empson on Doctor Faustus</a><br>
Empson’s question — how could an intelligent thinker like Faustus make an obviously stupid bargain? — prompted an enlightening answer from Christopher Ricks.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/mortalism.html">Marvell and Mortalism: A supplementary note to my essay on “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body”</a><br>
In my newsletter, Talk about books, I’ve discussed Andrew Marvell’s lyric poem, “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body”. This is a highly speculative note about the possible link between that poem and the Mortalist heresy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Paradoxical-ambition.html">The paradoxical ambition of Andrew Marvell’s <cite>Third Advice to a Painter</cite></a><br/>
This is an argument (a by-product of my thesis) about one of Marvell’s satires.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Prelate.html">“Prelate of the grove”: A note on ambition and preferment in Marvell’s “Upon Appleton House”</a><br>
The treatment of ambition and preferment in Andrew Marvell’s “Upon Appleton House” indicates the need to develop an acutely discriminating conscience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/religion-theodicy.html">“What course and opinion he thinks the safest”: Religion and divine justice in the work of Andrew Marvell</a><br>
Another by-product of my thesis, which was about justice as a theme in Marvell’s works. That topic was suggested to me by a book about his treatment of <em>divine</em> justice but I found that Marvell’s writings about divine justice engaged with theodicy only incidentally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/catholics-moore.html">Brian Moore, <cite>Catholics</cite></a><br>
Brian Moore’s 1972 novel is concerned with the clash between personal faith and institutional loyalty, or between conscience and the duty to obey. It ends on what I found to be an unconvincing paradox but I enjoyed the journey to get there.</p> 

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/skin-deep.html">Liz Nugent, <cite>Skin Deep</cite></a><br />
I previously wrote a mini-review of Liz Nugent’s <cite>Lying in Wait</cite> which you can find on <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/book-reviews.html">the book reviews page</a>. Here‘s a slightly more substantial discussion of her more recent novel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Sally-Rooney-short-stories.html">“Oh my god, shut up”: Sally Rooney, short story writer</a><br>
Before she was an acclaimed novelist, Sally Rooney was already a very impressive short story writer. Here, I discuss three of her stories which can be read on the web.</p>

<h2>Book reviews</h2>

<p>Most of the <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/book-reviews">book reviews from Goodreads</a> that I think are worth keeping have now been moved to this site.</p>

<h2>Micro.blog</h2>

<p><a href="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog">I use Micro.blog</a> mainly as an alternative to Twitter but from time to time I post longer pieces there. Here is <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Micro-blog-long-posts.html">a list of some of my longer posts</a> which I don’t necessarily want to see buried in the timeline.</p>
