<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Since January 2017, I’ve been posting most of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh">Medium</a>. During that time, I’ve been giving priority to fiction, particularly shorter forms. I’ve also posted a couple of pieces of what I’ve been loosely calling literary criticism, though maybe just “criticism” would be a more accurate term. <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/robert-galbraiths-cormoran-strike-books-7bd41682fbdc">Two of those</a> have been among <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/who-really-killed-the-generals-daughter-6d07a25b1e19">my most viewed</a> (and read) posts on the site, and are still available here. The other two, both essays on poetry, are perhaps a bit heavy going for Medium and can be found on this site (see <strong>Criticism and book discussion</strong> below).</p>

<p>And here&apos;s a list of <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/recommended-web-pages">blogs and personal websites that I like</a> and recommend.

<h3>My posts about aphantasia</h3>

<p>Apart from fiction and criticism, I’ve written an accidental series on the subject of aphantasia, since recognizing in March or April 2018 that I have that condition. (I’m using “condition” in the a wide sense, as equivalent to “state”, and not to imply that aphantasia is a medical condition or impairment.) Up to January 2019, I published those posts on Medium, More recent posts are on this site</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts">the list of posts so far</a> &mdash; I&apos;ll update it if and when I add more.</p>

<h3>My fiction on Medium</h3>

<p>I&apos;ve made <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list">a list of my own stories on Medium</a>. It includes several short stories, a novella and a novel, all of which are free to read. As a bonus, here is the shortest story I&apos;ve written so far, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Closure">Closure</a>&rdquo;. It comes in at about 750 words. I originally posted it on Medium but deleted it last year and now I&apos;ve reposted it here.</p>

<h3>Recent posts</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/gender-identity.html">A good masculinity is hard to find</a>: Part 2 — gender as identity<br>
I got through most of my adult life without ever thinking about gender as a question of identity. It’s normal for clashes over identity to lead to mutually contradictory, incompatible claims, and ultimately irresolvable disputes. “Woman” is a contested identity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/a-good-masculinity-anti.html">A good masculinity is hard to find</a>: Part 1 — episodes from the early life of an antimasculine male<br>
For some time, I’ve been trying to write about gender in general, even abstract, terms. But first I think I need to give an account of some of my own personal history as it relates to gender. This is the first part of an intended series of three posts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/PDF-small-screens.html">PDF is preferable to ePub, even on small screens</a><br>
The conventional wisdom may be wrong as to the relative merits of PDF and ePub in the dissemination of long form texts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Medium-posts.html">Some of my posts on Medium</a><br>
Here is a list of some of my posts on Medium that I think are worth keeping and that don’t fit into the broader categories of fiction, aphantasia or critical book discussion. The bulk of them date from 2017/2018, and most of them are about writing and/or publishing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/face-and-place-blindness.html">Heather Sellers: Learning the lessons of face-blindness and place-blindness</a><br>
A professor of creative writing can’t recognize faces or find her way around places she knows well. Her approach to dealing with this difficulty is something we can all learn from.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/music-distribution-formats.html">Music distribution formats</a><br>
I’ve just ordered a CD for the first time in 3 years and I’m wondering if I should do it more often. The things I don’t like about downloads are the absence of physical liner notes and careless, inconsistent or wrongheaded metadata.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/flow-defence.html">In defence of flow: a response to Barbara Gail Montero</a><br>
Professor Montero makes a persuasive case against the notion that excellence or mastery in performance can be achieved effortlessly, in an ecstatic state of altered consciousness. In spite of this, I’m not yet quite ready to give up the idea of “flow”.</p>

<h3 id="bookdiscuss">Criticism and book discussion</h3>

<p>This section is for links to my writing about other writing — in particular fiction, poetry and (conceivably, eventually) drama. At the moment, I’m for the most part alternating between two projects. The first is to turn my doctoral thesis (“Andrew Marvell’s ambivalence about justice”) into something more widely accessible; the second to examine how some authors have been able to maintain interest in the same or connected characters over a series of crime fiction novels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Sally-Rooney-short-stories.html">“Oh my god, shut up”: Sally Rooney, short story writer</a><br>
Before she was an acclaimed novelist, Sally Rooney was already a very impressive short story writer. Here, I discuss three of her stories which can be read on the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/religion-theodicy.html">“What course and opinion he thinks the safest”: Religion and divine justice in the work of Andrew Marvell</a><br>
A by-product of my thesis, which was about justice as a theme in Marvell’s works. That topic was suggested to me by a book about his treatment of <em>divine</em> justice but I found that Marvell’s writings about divine justice engaged with theodicy only incidentally.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ishiguro-never-let-me-go.html">Kazuo Ishiguro, <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite></a><br>
Restrained and understated it may be. but when you look closely Kazuo Ishiguro’s sixth novel is a horror story.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Robert-Galbraith-Lethal-White.html">Robert Galbraith, <cite>Lethal White</cite></a><br />
Nearly 18 months ago, I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/p/7bd41682fbdc">a post on Medium</a> in which I argued that each of the first three Cormoran Strike novels explores a different trope or sub-genre of crime fiction. Now, at long last, I’ve added my thoughts on the fourth novel in Robert Galbraith’s series.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/skin-deep.html">Liz Nugent, <cite>Skin Deep</cite></a><br />
I previously wrote a mini-review of Liz Nugent’s <cite>Lying in Wait</cite> which you can find on <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/book-reviews.html">the book reviews page</a>. Here‘s a slightly more substantial discussion of her more recent novel.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Marvell-gender.html">Andrew Marvell’s Gender</a><br />
This is an essay that I published in <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1093/escrit/cgw006"><cite>Essays in Criticism</cite></a> in 2016. As the title suggests, it looks at how gender informs Andrew Marvell’s writing. The version I’ve posted here is a HTML conversion of the approved draft. The final, definitive version is on <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1093/escrit/cgw006">the journal’s website</a>. That’s the version that should be cited, of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/overkills-deceptive-attraction-852b5b04843f">Gillian Flynn&apos;s plotting in <cite>Dark Places</cite>: The deceptive attraction of overkill</a><br />
My discussion of the plot of Gillian Flynn&apos;s second novel, <cite>Dark Places</cite> (2009).</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/rereading-kate-atkinsons-behind-the-scenes-at-the-museum-7e4635c9cc30">Rereading Kate Atkinson&apos;s <cite>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</cite></a><br />
Kate Atkinson’s first novel has a narrator who falls into three different types, each pulling in different directions. This results in a “teeming”, overstuffed tale whose profusion of detail tends to compensate for or distract from a glaring gap in the narrator’s memory. It’s a novel that requires to be reread.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/finite-though-unbounded">Finite though unbounded: the abolition of infinity in the poetry of William Empson</a><br/>
A long essay (originally 5,000 words, but it seems to have stretched a bit over the years) about a theme in the early poetry of William Empson, which I wrote in 1996 and now think is worth resurrecting in a very slightly revised form. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Paradoxical-ambition.html">The paradoxical ambition of Andrew Marvell’s <cite>Third Advice to a Painter</cite></a><br/>
This is an argument (really a by-product of my thesis) about one of Marvell’s satires.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/p/6d07a25b1e19/">Who really killed The General’s Daughter?</a><br/>
A discussion of the resolution of the plot of Nelson DeMille’s 1992 novel <cite>The General’s Daughter</cite>.</p>

This post deals with tropes and subgenres in the first three Cormoran Strike books. For <cite>Lethal White</cite>, see above.</p>

<h3>Book reviews</h3>

<p>Most of the <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/book-reviews">book reviews from Goodreads</a> that I think are worth keeping have now been moved to this site.</p>

<h3>Micro.blog</h3>

<p><a href="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog">I use Micro.blog</a> mainly as an alternative to Twitter but from time to time I post longer pieces there. Here is <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Micro-blog-long-posts.html">a list of some of my longer posts</a> which I don’t necessarily want to see buried in the timeline.</p>
