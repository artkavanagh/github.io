<h1>How and where to read short stories</h1>

<p class="intro">I posted the original version of this piece on Google+ in May 2018. I’ve been unsystematically going through my old Google+ posts, looking for ones that are still relevant and possibly worth reposting on this site or elsewhere. I’ve slightly updated this one to reflect the fact that I no longer send out my newsletter, “Recommended short fiction on Medium”, among other things.</p>

<p>It’s a truism that collections of short stories are a hard sell. Publishers are reluctant to take them because they know there’s a good chance that readers won’t be willing to buy them. I’ve tended to think of this as simply the way things are, without really wondering why it should be so. It’s for that reason that I had a kind of an “aha!” moment about a month ago [i.e. April 2018], when I saw a tweet from Sinéad Gleeson (@sineadgleeson on Twitter), the editor of <cite>The Long Gaze Back</cite>, a collection of short stories by Irish women. Gleeson quoted Mavis Gallant, who wrote in the Preface to her 1950 <cite>Collected Stories</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>Stories are not chapters of novels. They should not be read one after another, as if they were meant to follow along. Read one. Shut the book. Read something else. Come back later. Stories can wait.</blockquote>

<p>If story collections are not to be read as though they were novels, perhaps an approximately novel-length volume in which the stories are listed like chapters is not the best delivery mechanism for them. What is that volume, after all, but an invitation to the reader to read them in sequence, one leading on to the next, in about the same time as it would take her to read a novel? Does <em>that</em> explain why readers, and therefore publishers, are wary of the collection? Because the reader knows from experience that the volume is likely to remain unfinished, unreturned-to, a long-standing reproach?</p>

<p>These days, readers and writers alike of short stories are lucky to have a variety of alternatives to the collection bound up in a deceptively compact volume. The internet provides several of them, as you’d expect. If you’re a fan of short stories, you probably already have your preferred sites.</p>

<p>One such site is Medium, which is widely seen as a place to read (and publish) nonfiction of various kinds but is also eminently suitable as a platform for (particularly short) fiction. Between June 2017 and <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/whats-happened-to-my-short-fiction-on-medium-newsletter-32d4c51cbb2">August 2018</a>, I sent out a weekly newsletter in which I’d recommend the best short fiction I found on Medium each week. The stories I recommended in that period can still be found in these three posts:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/recommended-short-fiction-on-medium-620892c22019">Recommended short fiction on Medium</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/recommended-short-fiction-on-medium-2-677f60772439">Recommended short fiction on Medium—2</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/recommended-short-fiction-on-medium-3-1f879f184c9f">Recommended short fiction on Medium—3</a>.</li></ul>

<p>There are a number of excellent writers each of whom appeared in the newsletter twice and might easily have had a third or a fourth story included if I’d been prepared to recommend the same authors week after week. These star writers are listed in two posts, <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/some-of-the-best-fiction-writers-on-medium-9555e2118914">Some of the best fiction writers on Medium</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/some-more-of-the-best-fiction-writers-on-medium-5546998a5a19">Some more of the best fiction writers on Medium</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/uncollected-short-stories-431f5d849219">followed-up the original Google+ post on Medium, 27 May 2018</a>.</p>
