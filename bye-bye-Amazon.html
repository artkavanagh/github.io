<p>Towards the end of last year, I noticed that I hadn’t bought anything from Amazon for some time. It wasn’t a conscious boycott at that stage but clearly I’d had some idea that I wasn’t wholly comfortable with giving them my business. I won’t go into all the reasons for that discomfort — the most important was that the company had adopted a very predatory attitude towards booksellers and publishers, leading to the closure (actual or threatened) of many bookshops, for example.</p>

<p>So I decided to make my de facto boycott a conscious and declared one. And I left it at that, until <a href="https://micro.blog/kulturnation">@kulturnation</a> on Micro.blog <a href="http://kulturnation.micro.blog/2019/07/02/after-john-olivers.html">posted that he was in the process of closing down his Amazon account</a>.</p>

<p>In the last few years, I’ve deleted my Facebook and Twitter profiles but somehow it hadn’t occurred to me that this was something that I could equally well do with Amazon. The example of <a href="https://micro.blog/kulturnation">@kulturnation</a> showed me that it was. But first I needed to check whether there were any preparatory steps I needed to take.</p>

<p>While I’ve always preferred to get my ebooks from Apple rather than Amazon, I have managed to acquire a number of books in Kindle format over the years. Was I prepared to lose access to them when I cancelled my account. Frankly, yes — but there was no harm in seeing whether they could be salvaged, just in case I should ever want to reread them. I seemed that Calibre (which I’d previously used when <a href="https://medium.com/p/362c76c295d0">I was making an attempt at self-publishing</a>), can remove DRM if you install a plug-in.</p>

<p>I decided to give that a try but it turned out that only one of the books was still on my iPad or computer, it being the only one I’d reread more recently than three years ago. The rest had to be redownloaded, and they came in an updated format that was resistant to the removal of DRM. Oh well, it had just been an idea.</p>

<p>Two of the books I probably would have saved if I could were L S Hilton’s <cite>Maestra</cite> and S J Watson’s <cite>Second Life</cite>, both of which I’d reviewed on Goodreads in 2016. I read the reviews again and then decided that, since I wasn’t going to be able to take <cite>Maestra</cite> with me, I might as well reread it before I left Amazon. I was surprised by the disparity between my review — which gushed a bit — and my current experience of reading the novel. I didn’t feel that the book lived up to my review.</p>

<p>I think that, when I wrote the review, I must have been reacting in a contrarian manner to a lot of the “meh” commentary on Hilton’s book. “You don’ get it”, I was in effect saying. “It’s much better than you think.” It’s a weird feeling to read something you wrote just three years ago and find that you don’t agree with it, or even recognize it. I abandoned the attempt to reread <cite>Maestra</cite> after a couple of chapters, and immediately deleted the Kindle app from my iPad. But, though the app was gone, and with it the books, my Amazon account remained.</p>

<p>It was at that point that I reminded myself that Goodreads is an Amazon company too. If I was going to make permanent my boycott of the parent, didn’t it make sense to rid myself of any connection with the subsidiary at the same time? In fact, I’ve had a tolerate/hate <a href="https://medium.com/p/133b776bd468">relationship with Goodreads almost since I joined</a> it in late 2015, and I was quite pleased to have a reason to quit the site once and for all. The thing that had stopped me from doing so before was the perceived need to preserve the reviews I’d posted there. Now, partly because of my experience with the <cite>Maestra</cite> review, I’m less sure that they’re worth preserving. Recently, I’ve been tending not to write reviews (aimed at people who are trying to decide whether to read a book) but discussions that I hope get deeper into the book, <a href="https://medium.com/p/852b5b04843f">like this one, for example</a>.</p>

<p>However, I’ve decided I ought to keep the reviews of <cite>Maestra</cite> and <cite>Second Life</cite>, both as curiosities and as a reminder to myself that the strongly expressed (and held) opinions of three years ago can quickly become a source of puzzlement to their own author. I’ve now reposted both reviews on my own site:</p>

<ul>
<li>L S Hilton, <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/maestra-review.html">Maestra</a></li>
<li>S J Watson, <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/second-life-review.html">Second Life</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In a little over a week’s time, my profile on Goodreads will be gone for good. At that point, my Amazon account will already be history.</p>
