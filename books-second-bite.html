<h1>Some books I didn’t leave behind a second time</h1> 
<p>I spent an afternoon 2½ years ago in my sister’s attic near Toulouse, deciding <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/books-left-behind.html">which of the books I had left there 9 years earlier I wanted to take back to Ireland and which I was prepared to abandon forever</a>. The second group was much the larger, and I told my sister that she was welcome to do whatever she liked with them. Towards the end of last year, she let me know that they were still there, so I decided to go back and take a second bite at the cherry. Partly because of <a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/subscribe">Talk about books</a>, my priorities had changed: there were several books that I had been happy to leave behind before but that I now thought would be worth keeping after all. This time, I’d spend more than an afternoon going through the pile. I went for a week’s visit.</p>
<p>I quickly confirmed my suspicion that I had missed a box last time. Several books turned up that I had failed to find in 2020: my paperback copy of <cite>Ulysses</cite>, the first two of Kate Atkinson’s Jackson Brodie series, Candia McWilliam’s three novels, Steven Pinker’s <cite>The Blank Slate</cite>, Dibdin’s <cite>Dead Lagoon</cite> (which I had since replaced while <a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/after-all-zen-was-just-a-policeman">writing about his Aurelio Zen series</a>). I packed all of these. As I was inevitably going to take <cite>Ulysses</cite>, I decided that <cite>A Portrait of the Artist</cite> should come too, though I had intentionally left it behind the previous time.</p>
<p>But if I had found the box that was missing the first time, it seemed that a different one was eluding me now. I couldn’t find the Richard Tuck edition of Grotius, <cite>The Rights of War and Peace</cite> though I’m quite sure I’d seen the 3 hefty volumes when I was last there. If I had found them, would I have wanted to keep them? On the one hand, they had been quite expensive; on the other, I could probably get along without them very well. As it turns out, I don’t need to make up my mind about that.</p>
<p>In 2020, I had brought back only one Wilkie Collins, namely <cite>Armadale</cite>. This time, I added <cite>Basil</cite>, <cite>The Law and the Lady</cite> and <cite>The Moonstone</cite>; but where were <cite>No Name</cite> and <cite>The Woman in White</cite>? I had decided beforehand that I was going to take most of the Penguin Classics and Oxford World Classics that I’d come across, particularly if they were from the 19th century. So I got a few by Dickens and Austen: <cite>Little Dorrit</cite>, <cite>Our Mutual Friend</cite> and (I think — it certainly should have been there) <cite>Bleak House</cite>; <cite>Emma</cite> and <cite>Persuasion</cite> and (almost certainly) <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>.</p>
<p>There was no Hardy, though I had been expecting to find a copy of <cite>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</cite> at least. Something else I had been expecting to see but didn’t was the Penguin Classics <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite> introduced by Christopher Ricks. I’ve never got very far into it before, but I think I might be ready for it now. Oh, well.</p>
<p>I knew in advance that I wasn’t going to want any Lawrence. Nor did I pack any Conrad (where was <cite>Nostromo</cite>?) or (as far as I can remember) Woolf; and the only Kipling I took was <cite>Plain Tales from the Hills</cite>, though I hesitated over <cite>Kim</cite>. (The Penguin Modern Classics covers are hard to resist.)</p>
<p>Last time, I had been glad to recover William Empson’s <cite>Collected Poems</cite> but had deliberately restricted myself to two volumes of his criticism, <cite>Seven Types of Ambiguity</cite> and <cite>Milton’s God</cite>. (I already had <cite>Using Biography</cite> in Ireland.) This time around, I put aside all the others I could find, intending to go through them to see if there was anything I couldn’t bear to be without. In the end, I didn’t bother to go through them, but packed them all: <cite>Some Versions of Pastoral</cite>, <cite>The Structure of Complex Words</cite>, <cite>Argufying</cite> and the first volume of <cite>Essays on Renaissance Literature</cite>. The second volume of <cite>Essays on Renaissance Literature</cite> must be in the “missing” box.</p>
<p>There were a few other individual books that I had specifically decided against taking last time, and about which I had second thoughts: Ian McEwan’s <cite>Atonement</cite> and Zadie Smith’s <cite>White Teeth</cite> being the most obvious examples. I had taken everything else by McEwan that I could find, so so it seemed a bit odd not to take <cite>Atonement</cite> too.</p>
<p>The books are in 4 small boxes under a table in my sister’s séjour, awaiting collection (with <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/bringing-back-cd.html">a 5th full of CDs</a>). They ought (among other things), to fuel Talk about books for some time to come.</p>
