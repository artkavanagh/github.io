<h1>My posts about aphantasia</h1>

<p>In April 2018, I started to write about the subject of aphantasia. At the time, I thought the condition was an entertaining quirk, something I was amused to have unexpectedly discovered about myself, with few practical implications. The more I thought and wrote about it, though, the more it seemed to me that the absence of a visual imagination has had a profound effect on the way I perceive and relate to the world.</p>

<p>The posts listed below don’t reflect a consistent development in my thinking on the subject. Rather, I’ve been tentatively exploring the subjective experience of having this condition, and trying out ideas. It’s important that I emphasize that I’m neither a scientist nor medically qualified. What you will find here are merely the speculations of a fiction writer, attempting to record and respond to my own experience of aphantasia.</p>

<p>These are the pieces I’ve posted since April 2018 (at first on Medium and more recently on this site) in reverse chronological order:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/unspecific-nostalgia.html">I think I’m finally over France</a><br>
For years, I’ve felt nostalgic for places where I used to live, particularly Dublin and France. I now think that my inability (because of SDAM) to recapture in memory my experiences in these places has led me to try to relive them in actuality, though I know this is impossible. It’s timee to stop chasing something that I’m not equipped to catch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html">I forgot the future: SDAM, aphantasia and a purpose in life</a><br>Before I knew I had aphantasia and SDAM, a psychotherapist asked me what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I had no idea. But now I know. It helped that I discovered that it’s not necessary to see the future in order to have one.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-dream-in-colour.html">Does someone with aphantasia dream in colour?</a><br>For years, I believed that my dreams were vivid and eventful, I just couldn’t remember them. Then I tried keeping a dream diary.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/the-five-stages-of-coming-to-terms-with-aphantasia-fe36947af410">The five stages of coming to terms with aphantasia</a><br>2018 was the year that I discovered that my inability to visualize is not something that everbody shares, and that we don’t all imagine and remember in the same way. I look back on my changing thoughts and feelings about this discovery at the end of that first year.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/motivation-productivity-and-aphantasia-5f8642ea7c34">Motivation, productivity and aphantasia</a><br>It’s easy to overlook the importance of being able to “see” the thing that motivates you. It’s hard to imagine now but for years I believed that I could and should be motivated by an abstract idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-sex-and-gender-12166b4364ea">Aphantasia, sex and gender</a><br>I’m just starting to appreciate the extent to which sex and memory are intertwined. That has implications for me, as a person with SDAM, but I haven’t yet got very far in working out what those implications are.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-and-executive-function-c7a5cb05162c">Aphantasia and executive function</a><br>It’s possible that an inability to visualize may impair our nonverbal working memory, an important executive function.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-can-look-a-bit-like-adhd-e81dc7e0e259">Aphantasia can look a bit like ADHD</a><br>Inability to focus? Unfinished projects? A chaotic workspace and poor tidying-up skills? An unshakeable conviction that gratification deferred is gratification forgone? That’s all to be expected when you can’t “see” things in your head.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/gender-identity-and-aphantasia-e0c93850ffb1">Gender identity and aphantasia</a><br>Is the lack of a sense of gender identity the result of not having a visual self-image, or are the two absences independent of each other? It’s difficult to be sure when you can’t experience somebody else’s self-perception.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/anxiety-identity-and-self-image-40288046b46b">Anxiety, identity and self-image</a><br>If you can’t form mental images, one of the things you won’t be able to picture in your head is yourself. Is a nonvisual self-concept actually better than an inevitably distorted self-image, or would it be preferable to have the pictures, however unreliable?</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/might-aphantasia-be-learned-behaviour-47dc4c72026">Might aphantasia be learned behaviour?</a><br>Aphantasia is authoritatively believed to be inherited, but there is at least one known case of it’s being acquired following injury. So perhaps it can be either. I take a highly speculative look at my own childhood (to the extent I can remember it).</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/there-is-no-plan-a-e969c8f9587">There is no Plan A</a><br>People who can’t visualize are incapable of holding a road map, a plan or a workflow diagram in our heads, nor can we take a quick mental glance at our schedules. Some aphantasics have found workarounds for planning, prioritizing and scheduling, but by no means all of us.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-memory-and-self-image-2db66c17c5f3">Aphantasia, memory and self-image</a><br>There seems to be a connection between aphantasia and SDAM (severely deficient autobiographical memory). After all, if you can’t “see” your memories, you’re hardly going to experience them vividly. Also: the disconcerting experience of failing to recognize oneself in a photo.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/aphantasia-is-not-a-disability-511989fa1e71">Aphantasia is not a disability</a><br>Aphantasia affects different people in very different ways, depending on a variety of factors, notably their occupations, circumstances and personalities. For many it seems to have no adverse affects at all and for most it is no more than an inconvenience.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/straight-a-s-a2b0b3bc8425">Straight &ldquo;A&rdquo;s</a><br>I thought I might have long-undiagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder. The therapist surprised me by telling me that what I actually suffer from is anxiety. No doubt she’s right, but what I didn’t know while I was seeing her is that I also have aphantasia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there’s a post about autobiographical or episodic memory, and how I dealt with that subject in a short story before I knew I had aphantasia:</p>
