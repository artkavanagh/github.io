<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/even-plainer-text.html">Even plainer text</a><br>
A suggestion for writing a basically structured document in plain (i.e. UTF-8) text without reference to an external style sheet and with as little markup as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/body-in-the-matrix.html">The body in <cite>The Matrix</cite></a><br>
I watched <cite>The Matrix</cite> only once, and didn’t like it, to the extent that I didn’t bother to watch the sequels. A piece in <cite>Vox</cite> by Emily VanDerWerff about the film as an allegory of gender transition has made me realize why I’ve been refusing the red pill. It has to do with transcending the body’s limitations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/poetry-scholarly-editions.html">Reading poetry in scholarly editions</a><br>
Scholarly editions of poetry provide some protection against anachronistic readings, misinterpretation and other errors. Unfortunately, that protection comes at a price.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/gender-as-behaviour.html">A good masculinity is hard to find</a>: Part 3 — gender as behaviour</br>
The old-fashioned notion of gender-as-behaviour has recently been overshadowed by the concept of gender identity. But there are still useful things to be said about the older idea. For one thing, having believed for more than 35 years that masculinity and femininity were “merely social constructs”, I’ve recently changed my opinion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-plain-text.html">Writing “plain” text</a><br>
For the past few years, I’ve been doing most of my writing as unformatted text, what some people still insist on describing as “plain”. Sounds like it might be time to dust off the old AlphaSmart, if it still works. But can it cope with UTF-8?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/tech-disconsolations.html">Tech’s unfulfilled promises</a><br>
Tech held out the promise of helping to free humanity from drudgery, boredom and hard physical work. Obviously, that promise hasn’t been kept. So, what now?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/gender-identity.html">A good masculinity is hard to find</a>: Part 2 — gender as identity<br>
I got through most of my adult life without ever thinking about gender as a question of identity. It’s normal for clashes over identity to lead to mutually contradictory, incompatible claims, and ultimately irresolvable disputes. “Woman” is a contested identity.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/a-good-masculinity-anti.html">A good masculinity is hard to find</a>: Part 1 — episodes from the early life of an antimasculine male<br>
For some time, I’ve been trying to write about gender in general, even abstract, terms. But first I think I need to give an account of some of my own personal history as it relates to gender. This is the first part of an intended series of three posts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/PDF-small-screens.html">PDF is preferable to ePub, even on small screens</a><br>
The conventional wisdom may be wrong as to the relative merits of PDF and ePub in the dissemination of long form texts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/face-and-place-blindness.html">Heather Sellers: Learning the lessons of face-blindness and place-blindness</a><br>
A professor of creative writing can’t recognize faces or find her way around places she knows well. Her approach to dealing with this difficulty is something we can all learn from.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/music-distribution-formats.html">Music distribution formats</a><br>
I’ve just ordered a CD for the first time in 3 years and I’m wondering if I should do it more often. The things I don’t like about downloads are the absence of physical liner notes and careless, inconsistent or wrongheaded metadata.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/flow-defence.html">In defence of flow: a response to Barbara Gail Montero</a><br>
Professor Montero makes a persuasive case against the notion that excellence or mastery in performance can be achieved effortlessly, in an ecstatic state of altered consciousness. In spite of this, I’m not yet quite ready to give up the idea of “flow”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/web-good-old-days.html">The good old days of the web may be just around the corner</a><br>
We need to go back to the future of the worldwide web. A follow-up to my article on LinkedIn, <a href="https://blog.artkavanagh.ie/advertising-and-the-future-of-surveillance-capitalism-15981fdda3e4">Advertising and the future of surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/following.html">I was not born to follow</a><br>
Why I think “following” isn’t a very satisfactory model, either for social media or the open web. Unexpectedly (to me at least), this turns out to be a follow-up to my recent post about Google and the future of search.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/living-without-Amazon.html">Living without Amazon</a><br>
It’s four months since I deleted my Amazon account. Getting by without ordering from the online retailer is at worst a minor inconvenience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Google-future-search.html">Why Google might just conceivably be the future of search</a><br>
The existence of sites like Million Short suggests that many of us suspect that the kind of algorithmic search pioneered by Google may not be reliably turning up the best and most relevant results, and that the problem only gets worse as the web expands. We need something better.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/death-of-the-book-review.html">The book review is slowly dying, and we don’t need to mourn it</a><br>
Book reviews have become an impoverished form of writing. The internet needs a more critical and enlightening kind of book discussion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-and-survivorship-bias.html">Survivorship bias in writing and publishing</a><br>
We all want to avoid irrational thought patterns but it may not be a good idea for writers, publishers and literary agents to worry too much about being fooled by survivorship bias. This is why.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-and-real-books.html">More thoughts on ebooks and real books</a><br />
I’ve been critical and dismissive of ebooks in recent posts. That <em>doesn’t</em> mean that I always prefer to read from a printed page rather than a screen but rather that I believe that ebooks have so far failed to make the most of the possibilities of digital publication.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-could-be-real-books.html">How ebooks could become real books</a><br />
This is a follow-up to something I posted two months ago on Medium: <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/ebooks-not-real">Why ebooks aren’t real books</a>. It would require a change of attitude towards ebooks by publishers (traditional and indie) and also by suppliers such as Apple Books.</p>
