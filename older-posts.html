<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/bye-bye-Amazon.html">Preparing to close my Amazon account</a><br />
I haven’t bought anything from Amazon since November 2017 and I don’t intend to again. But it’s only recently struck me that I might as well go the whole hog and delete the account. But that means losing access to the Kindle books I already have.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Medium-paywall-change.html">Medium&apos;s paywall — a change of approach</a><br />
Medium has made changes to the way posts are recommended and promoted, as a result of which I need to change my approach to the paywall, and revisit the question which stories to post on this site and which on Medium.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/phone-smarts">The phone&apos;s not smart so you might have to be</a><br/>
What&apos;s the ideal smartphone for someone who doesn&apos;t like phones?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-fiction-medium">Short fiction on Medium &mdash; recommendations</a><br/>
Though I&apos;ve ended my email newsletter, &ldquo;Recommended short fiction on Medium&rdquo; after a little over a year, I&apos;m still very fond of the title and I want to continue to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-subscription">Could subscription reading put paid to the ebook</a>?<br/>
Writers, &ldquo;aspiring&rdquo; and the other kind, would do better to look to subscription services than to the Kindle ecosystem if they want to make money from their writing. At the moment the closest thing to a subscription publishing model that&apos;s open to self-publishers and isn&apos;t (like Kindle Unlimited) under Amazon&apos;s control is Medium.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/HTML-Markdown">HTML and Markdown</a><br/>
Though I think Markdown is (from a writer&apos;s point of view) elegant and enjoyable to use, it's also frustrating and a reminder of a missed opportunity.</p>
