<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/read-short-stories.html">How and where to read short stories</a><br>
Books the approximate size and shape of novels are probably not the best delivery system for (collections of) short stories. The web has opened up alternative possibilities. A revised version of a Google+ post originally from May 2018.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/LaTeX-and-Word.html">More about LaTeX as a writing tool: LaTeX and Microsoft Word</a><br>
In a follow-up to my post from 2 weeks ago on <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/LaTeX-writing-tool.html">LaTeX as a writing tool</a>, I look at Daniel Allington’s critique of LaTeX evangelism (or, as he puts it, the LaTeX fetish).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/death-of-the-book-review.html">The book review is slowly dying, and we don’t need to mourn it</a><br>
Book reviews have become an impoverished form of writing. The internet needs a more critical and enlightening kind of book discussion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/LaTeX-writing-tool.html">LaTeX as a writing tool</a><br>
On Micro.blog, <a href="https://micro.blog/ciaran">Ciaran Connelly</a> has been publishing a series of microposts on the subject of writing tools for lawyers, specifically for the production of legal documents: pleadings, contracts etc. His posts prompted me to think again about the relative merits of HTML (and Markdown) on the one hand and LaTeX on the other.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-and-survivorship-bias.html">Survivorship bias in writing and publishing</a><br>
We all want to avoid irrational thought patterns but it may not be a good idea for writers, publishers and literary agents to worry to much about being fooled by survivorship bias. This is why.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Pinterest-grid.html">Pinterest “breaks” the grid</a> — but in the tamest, most conformist way imaginable<br />
I had been puzzled by the hold that Pinterest seems to have over me, until I came across the unfamiliar phrase “anti-grid design”.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-and-real-books.html">More thoughts on ebooks and real books</a><br />
I’ve been critical and dismissive of ebooks in recent posts. That <em>doesn’t</em> mean that I always prefer to read from a printed page rather than a screen but rather that I believe that ebooks have so far failed to make the most of the possibilities of digital publication.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-could-be-real-books.html">How ebooks could become real books</a><br />
This is a follow-up to something I posted two months ago on Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/p/9d3fac7aae42">Why ebooks aren’t real books</a>. It would require a change of attitude towards ebooks by publishers (traditional and indie) and also by suppliers such as Apple Books.</p> 

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/bye-bye-Amazon.html">Preparing to close my Amazon account</a><br />
I haven’t bought anything from Amazon since November 2017 and I don’t intend to again. But it’s only recently struck me that I might as well go the whole hog and delete the account. But that means losing access to the Kindle books I already have.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Medium-paywall-change.html">Medium&apos;s paywall — a change of approach</a><br />
Medium has made changes to the way posts are recommended and promoted, as a result of which I need to change my approach to the paywall, and revisit the question which stories to post on this site and which on Medium.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/phone-smarts">The phone&apos;s not smart so you might have to be</a><br/>
What&apos;s the ideal smartphone for someone who doesn&apos;t like phones?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-fiction-medium">Short fiction on Medium &mdash; recommendations</a><br/>
Though I&apos;ve ended my email newsletter, &ldquo;Recommended short fiction on Medium&rdquo; after a little over a year, I&apos;m still very fond of the title and I want to continue to use it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-subscription">Could subscription reading put paid to the ebook</a>?<br/>
Writers, &ldquo;aspiring&rdquo; and the other kind, would do better to look to subscription services than to the Kindle ecosystem if they want to make money from their writing. At the moment the closest thing to a subscription publishing model that&apos;s open to self-publishers and isn&apos;t (like Kindle Unlimited) under Amazon&apos;s control is Medium.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/HTML-Markdown">HTML and Markdown</a><br/>
Though I think Markdown is (from a writer&apos;s point of view) elegant and enjoyable to use, it's also frustrating and a reminder of a missed opportunity.</p>
