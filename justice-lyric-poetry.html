<h1>Chapter 1. The problem of justice in Marvell’s pastoral and lyric poetry</h1>

<h2>“Ev’n beasts must be with justice slain”</h2>

<aside>For the debate as to whether the poem is an allegory and, if so, what kind of allegory, see my thesis, <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/andrew-marvells-ambivalence-about-justice(dbffe76a-5445-4aa7-8fc0-5ef357c84cdc).html"><cite>Andrew Marvell’s ambivalence about justice</cite></a> (2012), notes 6–11 to Chapter 3, pp.&nbsp;128–9.</aside>
<p class="continue">More than any other poem of Marvell’s, “The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn” seems to offer the reader a multitude of possible, yet mutually inconsistent, interpretations. For decades if not centuries, critics have debated whether the poem is an allegory and, if it is, whether the allegory is religious or political.</p>

<p>The title contains the first of the poem’s many ambiguities. The word “fawn” has attracted some discussion but of more interest for my purposes is “complaining”. It indicates, primarily, the obvious fact that the poem is a lament, but it also has a legal meaning, and the reader soon sees that, as well as lamenting her slain pet, the nymph claims that its killing was the denial of a right:</p>

<blockquote>It cannot die so. Heaven’s King<br>
Keeps register of everything:<br>
And nothing may we use in vain.<br>
Ev’n beasts must be with justice slain;<br>
Else men are made their deodands.<br>
Though they should wash their guilty hands<br>
In this warm life-blood, which doth part<br>
From thine, and wound me to the heart,<br>
Yet could they not be clean: their stain<br>
Is dyed in such a purple grain.<br>
There is not such another in<br>
The world, to offer for their sin. (ll. 13–24)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">The nymph protests that she does not wish the killers ill (ll. 7–8), and it soon becomes clear that part of the reason for this is their punishment would be ineffectual to undo the wrong they have done: “There is not such another in / The world, to offer for their sin.” The second thing to note is that the nymph attempts to posit an exact equivalence — what might be called a quantitative concept of justice — between the killing by a pet of a human and that by a human of a pet. “Deodand” referred to a chattel (a term that could include a tame animal) which had occasioned the death of a human, and which was therefore “forfeit to the king, to be applied to pious uses”. Critics have sometimes been surprised that the childish vocabulary of the nymph should include such a technical word. It is indeed a surprise that she uses it but this is not an effect that Marvell achieves at the expense of verisimilitude. In Blackstone’s <cite>Commentaries on the Laws of England</cite> we read: “Deodands are granted out to lords of manors … to the perversion of their original design.” Deodand was experienced, inevitably, as a tax; but was particularly objectionable because its imposition was arbitrary and unpredictable, being occasioned by accidental death. It was not, in other words, a term that would be remote from the lives of farm labourers and others who worked with dangerous implements.</p>

<aside>Margarita Stocker finds allusions to the returning Astraea of Virgil’s Eclogue IV in the “Letter to Doctor Ingelo” and in the picture of Maria at the end of “Upon Appleton House”: Margarita Stocker, “Remodeling Virgil: Marvell’s New Astraea”, <cite>Studies in Philology</cite> 84 (1987), pp. 159–879; and Margarita Stocker, <cite>Apocalyptic Marvell: the Second Coming in Seventeenth-Century Poetry</cite> (Harvester Press, 1986), pp. 137–64. If Astraea is indeed a presence in “The Nymph Complaining”, it is the departing goddess who “terras … reliquit” in Ovid’s Metamorphoses Bk. 1, rather than Virgil’s returning one.</aside>
<p>The inverted application of the concept of deodand to the human killers produces an absurd result which casts doubt on the efficacy (and fairness) of its actual application. The absence of “such another … to offer for their sin” suggests that reparation (and still more so retribution) may too often be the adding of one wrong to another rather than the cancelling out of the original wrong by its opposite. The nymph chooses to die too, but without any sense that her death atones for the killing of the fawn. In this she resembles Astraea rather than Christ — abandoning a world in which justice has failed, rather than allowing herself to be sacrificed in order to restore it.</p>

<p>It may be the case that the nymph is overreacting outrageously to the kind of minor event that happens every day. But if she is right in asserting that reparation for the fawn’s death is impossible, then the trivial nature of the actual occurrence is no real consolation. If justice is not available in such a small matter, she may not be able to find it in a larger one either. The troopers’ action has been “wanton”: arbitrary, unpredictable and unjustified. This is one of the reasons why the event described in the poem does not seem trivial, though the reader does not share the nymph’s emotional attachment to the animal.</p>

<p>I am not, of course, offering this as a complete account of the poem. For one thing, I have so far discussed only the frame of the story. The framed narrative, the story of Sylvio’s gift, his betrayal of the nymph and his replacement as the object of her love, is equally concerned with what the nymph sees as an injustice she has suffered. Sylvio has done her an injury. She may have no right to prevent him from taking his heart, but his actions have (she implies) given rise to a legitimate expectation that he would not do so. He has beguiled her. She does not say how; possibly the memory of her own credulity is too painful for her to make more than a glancing reference to it. The whole course of the courtship is related in twelve lines out of the poem’s 122, and the first two of these immediately reveal that it did not go well. The end of the affair is briefly told:</p>

<blockquote>But Sylvio soon had me beguiled.<br>
This waxèd tame, while he grew wild,<br>
And quite regardless of my smart,<br>
Left me his fawn, but took his heart. (ll. 33–6)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">The nymph, it seems, is bravely trying to be objective, to assign to Sylvio’s breach with her the importance it properly bears in the overall scheme of things. But, as she exaggerates the importance of the fawn’s slaying she understates that of Sylvio’s betrayal. Indeed, it is arguably because she has played down the latter that she attaches an excessive importance to the former. This draws attention to the relationship between the two losses — to the extent to which the fawn has been substitute for Sylvio’s love. If the death of the fawn, whatever its significance in the history of the universe, is no minor matter to the nymph, then neither is Sylvio’s breach of faith, despite her almost dismissive allocation of just four lines to its narration.</p>

<p>But remember that the nymph <em>complains</em> for the death of her fawn: that is, she pleads for justice and redress. Has she any reason to expect redress for Sylvio’s beguiling? Part of the huntsman’s deception, it is implied, is that he has presented the fawn as one thing — a token of love — while intending it as something else entirely — compensation for the withdrawal of love; or rather, since love can never be guaranteed, for the withdrawal of his presence:</p>

<blockquote>Said he, ‘Look how your huntsman here<br>
Hath taught a fawn to hunt his dear.’<br>
…<br>
And quite regardless of my smart<br>
Left me his fawn, but took his heart. (ll. 31–2, 35–6)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">After his departure, if the nymph wishes to minimize her losses, she has little choice but to take Sylvio’s offering in the spirit in which she believes it was intended. The responsibilities that he has assumed towards her have been regarded by him, without her knowledge, as being in the nature of contractual obligations, capable of being discharged by payment of compensation. It may be significant that the only unambiguous reference to the fawn as a gift occurs in the context of the nymph’s speculation about its possibly proving false:</p>

<blockquote>Had it lived long, I do not know<br>
Whether it too might have done so<br>
As Sylvio did: his gifts might be<br>
Perhaps as false or more than he. (ll. 47–50)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">The gift is false indeed, though not necessarily in the way she imagines. If it had been what it appeared to be, a love token, it would have been no part of a bargain — a genuine gift. In the context of rights and obligations in which it is actually given and received, the term is misleading.</p>

<p>The troopers’ wanton action, then, deprives the nymph of the compensation she ought to have had for the loss of Sylvio. Even before that happened, there were indications that the compensation was not entirely commensurate with the loss she had suffered. She says:</p>

<blockquote>But I am sure, for ought that I<br>
Could in so short a time espy,<br>
Thy love was far more better then<br>
The love of false and cruel men. (ll. 51–4)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">Here, Marvell appears to be using a familiar device to suggest that we should not take at face value the nymph’s comparison between what she has lost and what she has found. Like several other speakers in his poetry, she is unable to distinguish between subject and object. “Thy love” is, on the face of it, a subjective genitive: the love of the fawn for the girl who feeds it and allows it to play in her garden. “The love of false and cruel men”, in contrast, is primarily an objective genitive, since men who are “false and cruel” cannot be supposed to feel much love. The difference between the two formulations is stressed by the use of the possessive pronoun “Thy” in one and not in the other. In effect, the nymph says that it is better to be loved by the fawn than to love false and cruel men, a statement plausible enough in itself but which is rendered doubtful by her treatment of the fawn’s love and that of the men as comparable.</p>

<p>The nymph’s attempt to make a judgment of value is compromised by her inability to distinguish between the terms of the comparison. A capacity for judgment may not be something we expect to find in the nymph: she is, after all, the complainant, and we should be surprised to find her acting as a judge in her own cause. She is not impartial, but it does not follow that she is not right, or that the wrongs which have been committed against her are not serious injustices. If Sylvio’s compensatory “gift” is not of equal value to his heart, then the nymph has already been the victim of an injustice before the troopers have come along and deprived her of even that consolation. The implication is that as there is no equivalence between a fawn and a heart — as, indeed, the two are not comparable because different in kind — it may well be that the very possibility of a compensatory justice, relying as it does on incomplete resemblances and perceived rather than real equivalences, is as illusory and deceptive as a pun. At law, compensation for an injury has generally taken the form of damages. A broken limb, the incapacitation of a breadwinner, a sullied reputation are all converted by the legal process into sums of money. The relationship between the injury and the damages awarded is necessarily an arbitrary one and the awards themselves (except when made by a jury) are frequently ungenerous. A major part of the administration of justice is taken up with the attempt to equate the incommensurable.</p>

<p>In its linking of the two stories, the poem lies at the meeting point of the public and private spheres. The nymph is forced to distinguish between the public injustice done to her by “wanton Troopers” (a phrase that encapsulates the idea of an armed force unchecked by any rational discipline or control; or, to put it another way, the disjunction of might and right) and the private, domestic hurt occasioned by Sylvio, even as she stresses the relationship between these two injuries. Having made the distinction, she describes the public wrong in terms that suggest it to be the more serious injustice, the wrong that she asserts to be irreparable, while relegating the private wrong to the level of an old story, quickly told. The reader suspects that the hurt felt by the nymph is much greater at the private than at the public wrong. However, the law would take a relative attitude to the two events remarkably similar to that expressed by the nymph: it would be more likely to notice, and to offer a remedy for, a wanton act of destruction of private property than a breach of faith in an affair of the heart. (It is true that, until the nineteenth century, there existed a legal remedy for breach of promise of marriage. Its application was limited, however, and the world in which such a remedy would be useful seems remote from the nymph’s). Is it possible that Marvell is suggesting that, in its inability to deal adequately with the personal sources of much of th hurt suffered by human beings and its tendency instead to concentrate its efforts on providing a remedy for public wrongs, the law adopts a perspective as distorted as the nymph’s? Whether or not it is, it seems clear from this poem that even the lesser and more publicly amenable injury is likely to go without an effectual remedy; a fortiori the greater and more private.</p>

<p>So, Astraea-like, the nymph prepares to depart from a world without justice. We should be careful not to make too much of this resemblance. What the nymph plans to do, once she has bespoken the fawn’s grave, is to die. Astraea, in contrast, did not die but became a star and eventually returned to earth. The resemblance lies solely in the fact that it is the absence of justice in the world that leads the nymph to wish to leave it. In a poem which already suggests a connection between her and Diana (l. 104) and, probably, draws a comparison between her and Niobe (l. 116) the addition of another classical allusion might appear to be confusing rather than elucidating. However, it can be argued that the recognition of the presence of Astraea in the poem helps to clarify the relevance of Diana and Niobe, given that the resemblances between them and the nymph are not entirely obvious. She does not, as Leo Spitzer has pointed out, resemble Niobe in boastfulness, and according to D&nbsp;C&nbsp;Allen she is not a mother. The significance of Niobe in this context, if my argument is correct, is as a demonstration that the gods can be excessive and unjustly vindictive in their punishments. The nymph’s relation to this image is an ambivalent one. Like Niobe, she is the victim of unjust treatment but, in her case, the treatment is not intended to punish her; at any rate, she has not disclosed any wrongdoing on her part that would merit punishment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, unlike Latona, she <em>appears</em> not to be vindictive. She says that she does not wish the troopers ill, and that she will pray that heaven “forget” (l. 10) the fawn’s murder. In part, as I have suggested above, this is because she cannot believe in the possibility of atonement or reparation. It should not, however, be mistaken for an indication of a generously forgiving nature. In fact, her use of “forget”, where “forgive” is expected and more appropriate, may be a deliberate rejection of the possibility of forgiveness. She immediately goes on to assert, in effect, that heaven <em>cannot</em> forget: its “King / Keeps register of everything” (ll. 13–14). It may be the case that, by choosing to pray for something that she knows to be impossible, rather than for something that she believes that God can readily grant, she is dissembling her vengeful feelings. Alternatively, it may be that she has no ill wishes to waste on the troopers because she has reserved them for Sylvio.</p>

<aside>Sarah Annes Brown, “Ovid and Marvell’s <cite>The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Faun</cite>”, <cite>Tranlsation and Literature</cite> 6 (1977), pp. 167–85. Sidney Gottlieb, while agreeing as to the poem’s Ovidian nature, sees the Heroides rather than the Metamorphoses as its model: Sidney Gottlieb, “‘The Nymph complaining for the death of her Faun’: Marvell’s Ovidian Study in Hysteria”, <cite>Huntington Library Quarterly</cite> 62 (1999), pp. 273–94, esp. at pp. 288–9.</aside>
<p>One of the best-known incidents involving Diana is the punishment of Actaeon (<cite>Metamorphoses</cite>. Bk. 3). He, having been turned into a stag by the goddess, is torn apart by his own hounds, in another example of a punishment that is clearly excessive. It might be inferred that the nymph regards Sylvio, the self-described “huntsman“ (l. 31), as a suitable candidate for similar treatment. By placing an offering in her shrine, the nymph is attempting to invoke the goddess in a context where a huntsman has offended. That it is the Actaeon episode from the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> that the reference to Diana should bring to mind is a reasonable, though not inevitable, inference from the poem’s evident debt to Ovid. Sarah Annes Brown has described ”The Nymph Complaining” as “a profoundly Ovidian poem”. This is a difficult proposition to demonstrate conclusively. While Cyparissus’s killing of a stag (<cite>Metamorphoses</cite> Bk. 10, ll.105–42) is one of the tales which has been seen as a possible source for the events described in “The Nymph Complaining”, and Niobe and the Heliades are also to be found in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, it would be dangerous to conclude on these grounds only that Marvell’s poem makes direct reference to Ovid’s. As Brown puts it, such stories “represent part of the furniture of the Renaissance mind, … they had been treated so very frequently by artists of all kinds that by Marvell’s time they were very common coin.” She therefore attempts to establish the Ovidian character of Marvell’s poem by showing that Marvell and Ovid share certain qualities of mind, such as the liking for reflexivity noted, in Marvell’s case by Christopher Ricks, a fondness for witty inversion and a preoccupation with the process of metamorphosis.</p>

<p>If Brown is right about the relationship of “The Nymph Complaining” to the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, this may help to elucidate the nature of the nymph’s slender yet apparently real resemblance to Astraea. That goddess’s position in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> is an ambiguous one. Explicit reference to her occupies just a line and a half: et virgo caede madentia / ultima caelestum terras Astraea reliquit (Bk. 1, ll. 149–50). Neverthrless, her star turn at the beginning of the poem might be said to mirror the apotheosis of Julius Caesar at its end. Her return to earth is not mentioned by Ovid but it is clear from Virgil and others that it coincides with the beginning of Augustus’s reign. In effect, Julius Caesar and Astraea have changed places: Caesar’s departure from the world  coincides with the return of Justice. To put it another way, although she is hardly mentioned in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, Astraea can be seen as a kind of presiding absence over the events described in that poem. Certainly, the injustice of the gods is one of its recurring themes.</p>

<p>If the punishments of Niobe and Actaeon appear excessive to an objective observer, it is because they are fixed by the injured parties themselves. Both Latona and Diana are, in effect, judges in their own respective causes; it follows that their actions can more properly be characterized as revenge than punishment. It may be that the nymph is aware that the injustice she deplores in the world is also part of her own constitution: that her desire for justice does not prevent her from harbouring vengeful wishes that she may not be able to refrain from acting upon, and that this fact reinforces her belief that justice is beyond reach. If even she, well meaining as she tries to be, is capable of injustice, how can she hope for justice from the world at large?</p>

<p>Another prominent classical reference in “The Nymph Complaining” might seem to undermine, or at least to complicate, this reading. The nymph’s tears are likened to those of “The brotherless Heliades” (ll. 99–100). The story of Phaethon (the brother of whom the Heliades have been deprived) had, on the face of it, less to do with justice and injustice than have those of Actaeon and Niobe. It is an analogue of the Fall, in which Phaethon’s desire for knowledge of his identity, his pride, and his aspiration to fulfill a role which is beyond his capability, leads both to his own death and to the near destruction of the earth’s fertility, the creation of deserts and extremes of climate. It would be possible to regard Phaethon’s death as fitting punishment for his pride, for his disregard of Phoebus’s pleas, and for his arrogantly inflated view of his own capacities. On the other hand, he is a young man who has just discovered that his parentage really does give him reason to be proud. Further, it is clear that the main reason for his death is not that he deserves to be punished, but that it is necessary to prevent further destruction. As Ovid relates the story, Phoebus complains that no one <em>deserves</em> to die for not being able to control his (that is, Phoebus’s) horses. In Sandys’s translation, the sun-god says:</p>

<aside>George Sandys’s, <cite>Ovid’s Metamorphoses Englished, Mythologiz’d and Represented in Figures</cite>, ed. Karl K Hulley and Stanley T Vandersall (University of Nebraska Press, 1970) p. 90 (Book 2, ll. 389–94).</aside>
<blockquote>Some other now may on my Chariot sit<br>
If all of you confesse your selves unfit;<br>
Let <i>Jove</i> ascend: that he (when he shall trie)<br>
At length may lay his murd’ring thunder by.<br>
Then will he finde, that he, who could not guide<br>
Those fire-hoof’d Steeds, deserv’d not to have dy’d.</blockquote>

<p class="continue">The necessity of Phaethon’s death is hard to deny, but that does not in iteslf render it just. In any case, by referring not directly to Phaethon, but to his grief-stricken sisters, Marvell makes it clear that such a necessary death, whether or not just in itself, may entail unmerited suffering on the part of the blameless.</p>

<h2>“Fame and interest”</h2>

<aside>Annabel Patterson, “<cite>Bermudas</cite> and <cite>The Coronet</cite>: Marvell’s Protestant Poetics”, <cite>ELH</cite> 44 (1977), pp. 478–99, esp. at p. 491.
Klause, <cite>The Unfortunate Fall</cite>, pp. 119–21, deals not with the ideas of justice that are evident in the poem, but with the difference between the “categorical” and “paradoxical” approaches to salvation.</aside>
<p class="continue">It might be argued that the attitude of the nymph bears some resemblance to that of the garland-maker in “The Coronet”, in that it is partly her own failure that persuades her of the unattainability of human justice, while his inability to avoid the “wreaths of fame and interest” (l. 16) prevents him from weaving a chaplet that will “redress that wrong” (l. 4) that the Saviour has suffered as a result of his sins. “The Coronet” has been seen as combining Calvinist ideas about the absurdity of attempting to earn or merit salvation with a meditation on the enormous difficulty of creating a religious art that is untainted by impure motives, including pride in one’s achievement and the desire for public admiration. It is surprising that more has not been written about the place of justice in the poem. John Klause spends relatively little time in <cite>The Unfortunate Fall</cite> of one of the few works in which Marvell explicitly writes about justice in the context of relations between humankind and the divine.</p>

<aside>Larry Brunner speaks of “an element of poetic justice” in the intended substitution of the coronet for the crown of thorns: Larry Brunner, “‘So Rich a Chaplet’: An Interpretation of Marvell’s <cite>The Coronet</cite>”, <cite>The Cresset</cite> 44 (September 1981), pp. 21–4.</aside>
<p>It is noteworthy that the poem’s speaker desires not to praise Christ, or to glorify him, or indeed to worship him; but specifically “to redress that wrong” (l. 4) that he has done Christ. He wishes to undo an injustice by making reparation for the part that his sins have played in Christ’s suffering and death. That suffering is represented by the crown of thorns to which the poem’s speaker has contributed. The speaker initially conceives the coronet of the title as the equivalent opposite of the crown of thorns. It is striking that it is in his very act of atonement to the Father for the sins of humankind that Christ sustains the wrong with which the garland-maker is preoccupied.</p>

<p>Christians believe that Christ suffered and died to atone to God for those sins. In addressing the question of sin and atonement, it is usual to think of the Father as the injured party and of Christ as the one who has made reparation. The garland-maker sees Christ from a less familiar point of view: as himself the injured party. In terms of human justice, it is possible to think of a number of situations in which somebody other than the debtor pays a debt — for example, when the creditor assigns it to a third party. The original creditor is satisfied, but the debtor still owes the debt, only now it is owed to the third party. The garland-maker is applying the same principles to relations between us and two of the persons of the Trinity. On the face of it, this is a reasonable thing to do, as our sins can indeed be said to be the effective cause of Christ’s suffering. However, as a result, the speaker finds himself in something of a trap. According to Christian doctrine, Christ’s sacrifice was necessary in the first place because humans are not capable of making atonement on our own behalf. If the speaker could not redress the wrong that he had done to the Father, why should he suppose that he will be able to redress exactly the same wrong when it is done to the Son? He finds that he cannot, recognizing that because of his mixed motives he is quite incapable of offering an adequate remedy for the injury. The skill and care (l. 24) which are a necessary condition of his weaving “So rich a chaplet … / As never yet the King of Glory wore” (ll. 11–12) are also a source of pride which undermines the value of that achievement.</p>

<p>It is not merely the lure of “fame” that taints and undermines the speaker’s efforts. There is also “interest”, which Annabel Patterson perceptively identifies with “his hopes of being able to ‘redress’ his previous errors by acts of poetic devotion” (“Marvell’s Protestant Poetics”, p. 491). His very wish to offer recompense for Christ’s suffering is itself in part the result of the serpent’s insinuation of sinful motives into what might appear to be the least selfish of acts. Specifically, the speaker is compelled to recognize that his attempt to “redress that wrong” is motivated, not purely by a desire to make up for the suffering of Christ, but also by his wish to free himself from the obligation to which his sins have subjected him. In short, he finds that he has been attempting to acquire rights as against God.</p>

<p>So long as it is assumed that the obligation he owes to Christ is equivalent to that for which Christ atoned to the Father, the sinner is caught in a paradox: on the one hand, the very obligation by which he is bound is precisely that he should attempt to atone for his sins while, on the other, if he should succeed in fulfilling his obligation, he would be discharged from it and would no longer owe anything to Christ; but to wish to be in this state — or to imagine that it is attainable — is itself sinful.</p>

<p>The paradox can be resolved only by Christ himself. Therefore, the speaker directs a prayer to him that offers two alternative suggestions:</p>

<blockquote>Either his slipp’ry knots at once untie,<br>
And disentangle all his winding snare:<br>
Or shatter too with him my curious frame:<br>
And let these wither, so that he may die,<br>
Though set with skill and chosen out with care. (ll. 20–4)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">With the first possibility, the speaker recognizes that it is open to Christ to purify his motives and thereby make him capable of weaving a chaplet that would <em>not</em> “debase … Heaven’s diadem” (ll. 17–18). He recognizes, with the second, that it may not please Christ to do this, but rather to destroy the serpent and coronet together. In that case, the crown of flowers will adorn the Saviour’s feet, not his head: it will not supplant the crown of thorns. In either event, he will not have been able to offer, by his own unaided effort, atonement for the injury to Christ.</p>

<p>We might, at this point, be drawn to the conclusion that the garland-maker’s error is to apply the terms of imperfect human justice to relations between us and God, or to treat human and divine justice as similar in kind. To seek to redress Christ’s wrong is, as I have suggested above, to conceive of him as the assignee of a debt. The very fact that this leads Marvell’s speaker into a trap must indicate that the comparison between the two orders of justice is misconceived. Human justice may derive from God’s but it is a debased and defective copy that can tell us very little about theodicy. The difficulty with this argument is that our human idea of justice is the only idea of justice that we have and that we cannot hope to grasp even an approximation of divine justice without reference to the human variety. Richard Baxter, in his <cite>Aphorismes of Justification</cite> (1649), is aware of the difficulty:</p>

<aside>Richard Baxter, <cite>Aphorismes of justification, with their explication annexed</cite> (1655), pp. 16–17.</aside>
<blockquote>I know mans guilt and obligation to suffer, is but Metaphorically called his debt. Therefore when we would search into the nature of these things exactly, wee must rather conceive of God as the Lawgiver and Governour of the World, then as a creditor, lest the Metaphor should mislead us. Yet because it is a common and a Scripture phrase, and conveniently expresseth our Obligation to beare the penalty of the violated Law, I use it in that sense. But here we are cast upon many and weighty and very difficult Questions. Whether Christ did discharge this debt by way of solution or by way of satisfaction?</blockquote>

<p class="continue">Baxter goes on to explain that to discharge a debt by way of solution is to pay back exactly the thing that is owed. This the creditor has no choice but to accept, and the debt is automatically discharged. To discharge by way of satisfaction, is to pay an equivalent which is acceptable to the creditor. In this case, the creditor has discretion whether or not to accept the payment. It is clear that Christ’s atonement belongs to the second category: the thing that was owed was our complete obedience to the divine law, and we remain disobedient notwithstanding that atonement.</p>

<p>Baxter similarly likens the sinner to a tenant who has built up arrears of rent which he will never be able to pay, and Christ’s atonement to the action of the landlord’s son who pays the debt and reinstates the tenant at a peppercorn rent (<cite>Aphorismes</cite> pp. 83–4). The substitution of a peppercorn for the original rent is a metaphor for Christ’s introduction of a new covenant. Baxter’s examples demonstrate that the attempt to understand divine justice in terms of our human conceptions is not necessarily hopeless and, incidentally, that the dilemma of Marvell’s garland-maker can be resolved if it is recognized that, through Christ’s forbearance (and only through that) our obligation to him may be considerably less onerous than the obligation that he satisfied on our behalf.</p>

<p class="continue">If my argument has been correct, certain of Marvell’s private, lyric poems — “Little T.&nbsp;C.”, “The Nymph Complaining” and, indirectly, “The Coronet” — exhibit a scepticism about justice that one would not expect to find in poems written in praise of a public figure. The latter type of poem will usually find it necessary to present the person being praised — the most obvious example in Marvell’s poetry is the Cromwell of <cite>The First Anniversary</cite> — as someone capable of restoring or upholding justice. “An Horation Ode” is unusual in this respect, since (as I argue in {???}) it praises Cromwell not in his capacity as putative future ruler but rather in that of obedient military leader. “Tom May’s Death”, which seems to participate in the same argument or discussion as the Ode, is starkly pessimistic about the possibility of attaining justice. The Ode has been described as “the most private of public poems”, while Carey’s remarks about “Tom May’s Death” bring out the ambiguity of its “wonderfully public” quality.</p>

<p>A poem that seems to be carefully positioned in the middle of the public-private spectrum is “Upon Appleton House”. In the early 1650s Marvell was tutor to the daughter of Thomas, third Baron Fairfax, who had been Cromwell’s predecessor as general of the army but had retired to his estate following the killing of the king. As many scholars and critics have pointed out, the poem contains a meditation on the active as against the retired life. However, it also seeks to show that Fairfax and his family have acted justly and can be expected to continue to do so. The justice theme is first encountered in the dilemma that confronts William Fairfax arising from the nuns’ attempt to frustrate his marriage to Isabel Thwaites:</p>

<blockquote>What should he do? He would respect<br>
Religion, but not right neglect:<br>
For first Religion taught him right,<br>
And dazzled not but cleared his sight.<br>
Sometimes resolved his sword he draws,<br>
But reverenceth then the laws:<br>
For Justice still that Courage led;<br>
First from a judge, then soldier bred. (stanza XXIX)</blockquote>

<aside>Andrew Marvell, <cite>An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government in England</cite>, ed. Nicholas von Maltzahn, in <cite>Prose Works</cite>, II, 229–30.</aside>
<p class="continue">On the face of it, this would suggest that there is a simple conflict between respect for religion, or its appearance, on the one hand and right on the other, the latter encouraging William to insist on the “promised faith” of Isabel Thwaites, the former tending to make him accept the nuns’ dispensation with it (ll. 196–7). The Catholic Church’s claim to be able to free people from the obligations of their oaths and promises was to remain a substantial ground of Marvell’s antipathy to that religion. In <cite>An Account of the Growth of Popery</cite> (1677), he wrote that the Pope “by his <em>Dispensation</em> annuls <em>Contracts</em> betwixt man and man, dissolves Oaths between <em>Princes</em>, or betwixt them and their People, and gives allowance in cases which God and nature prohibites.” The binding quality of oaths and contracts was, for writers such as Grotius and Hobbes, the foundation on which systems of law and justice rested. The Pope’s practice of dispensing with such obligations could therefore be seen as endangering the very existence of justice. Accordingly, “right” would entitle William Fairfax to insist that the marriage should go ahead, while “religion” maintained that Isabel’s promise to him no longer bound her.</p>

<p>However, the conflict between religion and right is not as straightforward as this reading suggests. It is significant that it is his reverence for the <em>laws</em> that inhibits William from marching into the convent with his sword drawn (ll. 229–30). This clearly suggests that considerations of right, rather than of religion, are causing him to hesitate. Conversely, respect for religion might actually require him to frustrate the nuns’ perversion of it. This would be consistent with Marvell’s presentation of the nuns as distorting scripture and his later insistence that:</p>

<blockquote>Though many a nun there made her vow,<br>
’Twas no religious house till now. (ll. 279–80)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">In this case, the presentation of William’s dilemma can be seen as Marvell’s attempt to imagine the situation of a conscientious Christian living before the Reformation. To such a person, at least some of the abuses and doctrinal errors of the Church would presumably have been apparent, but he or she would lack a legitimate basis on which to prefer the authority of his or her own conscience to the teachings of the Church. In such circumstances, reference for “the laws” (l. 230) might be the best way to reconcile the claims of conscience with outward obedience to the Church. In William’s case the dilemma is resolved when:</p>

<blockquote>The court him grants the lawful form,<br>
Which license[d] either peace or force,<br>
To hinder the unjust divorce. (ll. 234–6)</blockquote>

<p class="continue">With this judgment, religion and right are no longer in conflict, and William Fairfax is prepared to invade the nunnery and recover or rescue Isabel Thwaites. Subsequently (though not, as Marvell suggests, immediately), at the dissolution of the monasteries, the convent “To Fairfax fell as by escheat” (l. 274). The Fairfax family, then, has been well compensated for the inconvenience of the abduction. By compressing the timescale, Marvell is able to make the change of ownership appear a direct consequence of the nuns’ dishonourable and unjust attempt to “intercept” (l. 248) both Fairfax’s line and his future wife’s fortune.</p>

<p>The story of William’s dispute with the nuns may be fictional. Lee Erickson calls it “a founder’s myth, apparently invented by Marvell”, pointing out that Clements Markham’s biography of Lord Fairfax — which is cited by Margoliouth as establishing the facts — in turn relies on Marvell’s poem as its sole source for the circumstances of the dispute. Erickson further states that there is no record of any case in which a court granted “the lawful form” to William Fairfax, though Isabel had been a ward of the king, under the age of 16, at the time of her marriage. Specifically, he says that no relvant Chancery proceedings have been found.</p>

<p>Whether the episode is purely Marvell’s invention or he adapted a family tradition to his purposes, it is significant that that the house is said to have fallen to the family “as by escheat”. The expropriation is effected not by the well recognized legal process but by a procedure analogous to it. To determine the precise nature of the analogy, it is necessary to distinguish between two different but related meanings of the term. A&nbsp;W&nbsp;B&nbsp;Simpson makes a distinction between escheat propter defectum sanguinis and escheat propter delictum tenentis. Both refer to what was originally a feudal “incident”: the right of a feudal lord to take possession of land theretofore held by a tenant. In the first case, the right arose when the tenant died without heirs, in the second when the tenant was adjudged guilty of a felony. The second type was abolished in 1870 while the first survived until 1925. However, as the feudal system declined, the significance of escheat changed.</p>

<aside>Baker, <cite>Introduction to English Legal History</cite>, pp. 227–8.<br>
According to Baker (p. 252), the avoidance of incidents was a side effect rather than the main reason for the popularity of the conveyance to uses, which also provided a means of working around the inability of landowners to dispose of real property by will.</aside>
<p>In the first place, as it came to be more efficient to pay soldiers and agricultural workers in money than in land, the feudal <em>incidents</em> (such as escheat and wardship — benefits that accrued to a lord irregularly, as on the death of a tenant) assumed a much greater importance than the <em>services</em> that the system had been designed to secure. In the second, as the feudal pyramid gradually collapsed, more and more tenants came to hold directly of the monarch, without any intermediate (“mesne”) lords. By the Tudor period the Crown was the principal beneficiary of escheat and wardship which, however, were not economically significant because they were easily avoided by the device of conveying land to uses. Henry VIII successfully attacked, both by legislation and in the courts, the employment of uses to deprive him of the benefit of the feudal incidents.</p>

Blackstone, <cite>Commentaries</cite>, I, 292.Bryan A Garner, <cite>A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage</cite> (Oxford University Press, 1987, rpt. 1990), p. 222, shows that escheat, too, was susceptible to abuse: “From the perceived unfairness of the system — once the lords had begun to abuse it — evolved the aphaeretic form cheat.”</aside>
<p>The Statute of Uses (1536) was contemporaneous with the beginning of the dissolution of the religious houses — and Robert Palmer as argued that it took the precise form it did for reasons closely connected with the dissolution. Henry’s assault on uses resulted in a great increase in Crown revenue from escheat and wardship. It will be apparent that, like <em>deodand</em> in “The Nymph Complaining”, escheat in the second sense was a form of quasi-punitive confiscation: Blackstone mentions escheat in the paragraph immediately following his discussion of <em>deodand</em> as “[a]nother branch of the king’s ordinary revenue”.</p>

<p>Marvell glances at both meanings of “escheat”. The nuns are incapable of producing legitimate heirs, even though “virgin buildings oft brought forth” and though William Fairfax believes he knows “what fruit their gardens yield, / When they it think by night concealed” (ll. 86, 219–20). Officially, the nuns are sexually abstemious, but the poet regards them as enjoying an unnaturally unproductive erotic life. The lands belonging to convents and other religious bodies were held by corporations, which were incapable of dying and therefore had no need of heirs. In feudal times, this resulted in a loss of revenue for the feudal lords of these lands, since the incidents that ordinarily arose on the death of the tenant never fell due. A series of statutes in the thirteenth century had sought to deal with the problem, culminating in the Statute of Mortmain (1279). In practice, religious bodies continued to accumulate substantial landholdings, since the king frequently gave dispensations from the legislation.</p>

<aside>There is a further irony in the fact that Thomas Fairfax, by barring the entail on his estate, had avoided (or rather, as it turned out, postponed) the danger of its passing out of his family for want of male heirs: see Erickson, “Marvell’s <cite>Upon Appleton House</cite> and the Fairfax Family”.</aside>
<p>By the time of the dissolution in the second half of the 1530s, the feudal system had long since faded away (though, as we have seen, the feudal incidents were about to become significant again). When Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell set about divesting the religious houses of their assets, they employed a variety of methods among which escheat did not play a significant part. There is thus a complicated irony in Marvell’s statement that, so far as Nunappleton is concerned, the dissolution operated “<em>as by</em> esceat” (emphasis added).</p>

<p>In the first place, the nuns’ inability to produce legitimate heirs (reflecting the tenant corporation’s similar inability, as well as its “immortality”) meant that over the preceding centuries many potential escheats must have been indefinitely postponed. In the second, however, the nuns have particularly laid themselves open to escheat in the other sense, the consequence of felony. William Fairfax calls them “such thieves … / As rob though in the dungeon cast”, and claims that only death will restrain them from further cheating and theft (ll. 207–08). It is arguably just, then, that the nuns should be “in one instant dispossessed” (l. 272), but does it necessarily follow that the Fairfax family is entitled to benefit from the expropriation? Perhaps that “as by” raises a doubt. Perhaps, on the other hand, it attempts to quell one. If “The Nymph Complaining” suggests, among other things, that Marvell has doubts about the principle of <em>deodand</em>, it is conceivable that he had similar doubts about other types of confiscation. So, it might be the case that “as by” is meant to distinguish the Fairfax appropriation as being more just rather than less so than the feudal process to which it is compared.</p>

<p>The third factor that complicates the irony is the fact that, by the time of the dissolution, the person to whom any lands could be expected to fall as by escheat was the king, because mesne feudal lords were by then very rare. It cannot be assumed that Marvell was even aware of the feudal origins of escheat, so it is not necessarily the case that he is imagining Fairfax as being in the position of the nuns’ immediate feudal lord. But why otherwise would he present Fairfax as enjoying a right that would ordinarily be the king’s? At the time that Marvell’s poem was written, there no longer was a king. Moreover, feudal tenures and services had been ended by the Long Parliament, and would not be revived at the Restoration: Military Tenures Abolition Act 1660 (12 Car. II, c. 24). Escheat, however, was not abolished. Commissioners were appointed to collect this revenue for the benefit of the Commonwealth. Marvell was thus writing <em>at</em> a time when escheat had been sufficiently detached both from its feudal origins and its association with the Crown to survive the abolition of the monarchy and feudal tenures, <em>about</em> a time when its importance as a source of royal revenue, independent of its feudal origins, was being established.</p>
