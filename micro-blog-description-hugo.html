<h1>Adding a description to a Micro.blog post, using Hugo</h1>
<p><strong>Update, 23-Jan-2022</strong>: I’ve decided to remove this post because I’m not sure it’s useful or even that it will work in the long term. The JSON data file would need to be updated manually for each new post and I think this might break the way the template has worked in testing. Even if it does work, I'm not sure that it has much advantage over <a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/archive2022">a manually updated archive page</a> which is what I’ll be using for the time being.</p>
<p>I hope the deletion of this post won’t cause you any inconvenience. If it does, I apologize.</p>
