<h1>Jonathan Coe, <cite>What a Carve Up!</cite> review</h1>

<p>I'm reviewing this now, though I read it nearly 20 years ago, because the recent publication of a sequel of sorts in <cite>Number 11</cite> seems an excellent opportunity to see if <cite>What a Carve Up!</cite> stands up as well in reality as it does in my memory. I read it at a time when I'd finally and unwillingly come to accept that polemically political novels don't work. This novel, which is (among other things, but primarily) a viciously funny excoriation of the destruction of British institutions, particularly the NHS, under Thatcherism, forced me to modify that opinion.</p>
