<h1>Short fiction on Medium — recommendations</h1>

<p>Between June 2017 and August 2018, I had a weekly newsletter with the title “Recommended Short Fiction on Medium”. After a little over a year, I allowed it to peter out, for a number of reasons which I elaborated on in detail in the first version of this page but which no longer seem all that relevant.</p>

<p>While I’m relieved to be shot of the newsletter, I’m still very fond of the title and I’d hate to see it fall into complete disuse. There’s still a collection on Mix labeled “<a href="https://mix.com/artkavanagh/short-fiction-on-medium">Short fiction on Medium</a>” where I used to post links to each week’s recommendations just after I’d sent out the newsletters. I’ve continued to post links to recommended stories in this collection but I haven’t added any since the newsletter ended, just not as frequently as I did while the newsletter was extant.</p>

<h2>Recently recommended short stories on Medium</h2>

<p>Flora Cistoldi, “<a href="https://medium.com/@flora_cistoldi/strapontin-c4887add2c3a">Strapontin</a>”<br/>
If you read French, you might like Flora Cistoldi's short stories. This one likens an insomniac’s attempt to get to sleep to a miserably uncomfortable train journey.</p>

<p>Yulia Fedorov, “<a href="https://medium.com/the-junction/first-date-jitters-22ca9c4da56">First Date Jitters</a>”<br/>
First dates can be unbearably stressful. Luckily for Heather (or is it Anna?), she has a coping mechanism and a concerned doctor.</p>

<p>Sarah Lofgren, “<a href="https://medium.com/the-junction/the-bride-9aacbe2d16ae">The Bride</a>”<br/>
A compact but punchily effective story by Sarah Lofgren about the differences between a young woman’s expectations of marriage and her grandmother’s (not to mention the reader’s).</p>

<p>Kristen Roupenian, “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-good-guy-a-story-from-the-author-of-cat-person-59e5bfe9322f">The Good Guy</a>”<br/>
A long (15,000 words) short story from Kristen Roupenian’s collection, <cite>You Know You Want This</cite>, which also includes the phenomenal “Cat Person”. The irony is a little heavy-handed for my taste.</p>

<p>Jennifer Schmidt, “<a href="https://medium.com/lit-up/the-girl-in-the-mirror-9211b2a188a5">The Girl in the Mirror</a>”<br/>
A short story about beauty, disguise, selfhood and depersonalization. That’s a lot to fit into about 1,000 words but it’s all there.</p>

<p>From now on, whenever I add a new story recommendation to the Mix collection, I’ll simultaneously post it to my <a href="https://micro.blog/artkavanagh">Micro.blog</a> and update this page with a link to the story. I’m hopeful that Recommended Short Fiction on Medium can still be revived, just not as a newsletter.</p>

<p>You can find previous recommendations (these stories don’t go out of date) in that Mix collection or on these pages:</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/p/620892c22019">Recommended short fiction on Medium</a><br/>
<a href="https://medium.com/p/677f60772439">Recommended short fiction on Medium–2</a><br/>
<a href="https://medium.com/p/1f879f184c9f">Recommended short fiction on Medium–3</a></p>

<p>The authors who had a second story recommended in the newsletter are listed on these pages: </p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/p/9555e2118914">Some of the best fiction writers on Medium</a><br/>
<a href="https://medium.com/p/5546998a5a19">Some more of the best fiction writers on Medium</a><br/>
<a href="https://medium.com/p/6cddd43dfee1">Short fiction on Medium: now read on</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously with the original version of this page, I was writing a post in which I argued that <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-subscription">subscription services are a much better option than ebooks</a> for authors who’d like to make some money from their work, and that Medium is, in effect, the best subscription service available to self-publishing authors. This being so, it naturally struck me that I ought to revert to doing my bit to promote and encourage fiction writers to post their work on Medium. So here goes.</p>
