<h1>404 — Not found</h1>

<p>I’m sorry that you’re seeing this page. It means that the link you followed or URL you entered in your browser doesn’t point to a page that actually exists. The most likely reason for the error is that I moved a few dozen pages from Medium to this site, <strong>artkavanagh.ie</strong>. Most pages on Medium can be reached by one of multiple addresses, and it wasn’t practical to set up an alias for each variant, even if I knew them all.</p>

<p>The page you were looking for probably falls into one of the following categories. Just follow the relevant link, and there’s a good chance you’ll find the required page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html">My posts about aphantasia and/or SDAM (severely deficient autobiographical memory)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss">Book discussion, literary criticism and related posts</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/misc-from-medium.html">Miscellaneous posts that were previously on Medium</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can go to <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie">my home page</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck: I hope you find what you came here for or, failing that, at least something of interest. Sorry again for the inconvenience.</p>
