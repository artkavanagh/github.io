<h1>Mixed feelings about web discovery</h1>

<p>Have you heard of Mix? It’s a web discovery engine founded by Garrett Camp about two years ago as a new, improved replacement for StumbleUpon. I’ve been <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/getting-the-mix-just-right-f161fd9af9f6">using it fairly consistently since February 2018</a> but I think that experiment may have come to an end. Earlier this week I deactivated my account.</p>

<p>I’d been thinking about doing so for several months, for two reasons. First (from the point of view of the person looking for something to read), the combination of algorithmic recommendation and human curation doesn’t seem to produce results significantly better than Facebook’s unassisted algorithms. As <a href="https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/eluding-the-algorithm-5fd3d457923c">I wrote in May 2019</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Mix is coming to resemble a typical news feed on social media.</blockquote>

<p>The other reason (from the point of view of the writer/publisher looking for readers) is that, as with its “parent”, StumbleUpon, traffic referred by Mix tends to have a high <strong>bounce</strong> rate. I first noticed this earlier this year when I learned that the iPad app was loading the target page into an iframe without any kind of preview, so that people using the app were visiting the page before they’d had a chance to decide whether they were interested or not. In many cases they would immediately swipe on to the next recommended page. In the case of Medium posts, this led to an inflated number of page views accompanied by a rapidly falling read ratio. Because of this, <a href="https://artkavanagh.micro.blog/2019/04/27/is-garret-camps.html">I became much more wary about <strong>mixing</strong> my own posts</a>, particularly if those posts were on Medium.</p>

<p>I was no longer using Mix to discover new things to read, but only to share links to my own and other people’s writing. Since I wasn’t sharing my Medium posts and had no reason to think that other posts (mine or anybody else’s) had much to gain from page views coming from Mix, there didn’t seem to be any good reason to continue to post there. The only thing that made me hesitate before deactivating was the relatively high number of followers I had on the platform.</p>

<p>At 7,600, this was many times the combined total of followers I’d ever managed to accumulate on all other social media and similar platforms. The higher figure on Mix is no mystery: I had been a relatively early adopter and the curators had taken a liking to one of my collections, “Writers on writing”, so I was one of the people recommended to new sign-ups. Although I’m in the habit saying “<a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/following.html">Followers don’t count</a>”, was I really going to abandon an account that had 7,600 of them?</p>

<p>I procrastinated for several months but, in the end, it looks as if I am. There’s not much benefit in having a largish number of followers if I only occasionally share links to my own writing. But the immediate trigger for deactivating the account was that I noticed last week that Mix is no longer allowing comments. This was probably inevitable as the comments had become, to a large extent, a vehicle for spam. However, I find that I’m not very interested in using a platform that merely allows me to share links without adding any additional commentary. Where’s the “engagement” in that?</p>

<p>It seems that, while Mix allows me to deactivate my account, there’s no way to delete it outright. I <em>could</em> reactivate it at any time. But I don’t think I’ll be doing that.</p>
