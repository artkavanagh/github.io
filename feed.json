			"content_html": "<p>Henry Oliver complained a few days ago about <a href=\"https://commonreader.substack.com/p/ban-all-book-summaries\">the prevalence of plot summaries in book reviews</a> and in writing about books generally. He has a rule on The Common Reader: “No lengthy plot summaries”. I agree with this in principle but I’ve been finding it harder not to include substantial summaries in my own posts on <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/tabarchive/\">Talk about books</a>. Indeed, I’ve been finding it hard to prevent the summaries from dominating those posts. I was already persuaded that the latest post, about Rushdie’s <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/2023/08/13/what-not-one.html\"><cite>The Moor’s Last Sigh</cite></a>, has too much summary, not enough analysis, when I read Henry Oliver’s post, so I was ready to take his admonition to heart.</p><p>I often find that some measure of summary is necessary to support the argument I want to make. The problem, particularly with a novel as big and complex as <cite>The Moor’s Last Sigh</cite> is that the work of summarizing tends to be exhausting, and it left me with less time and energy for the argument than it ideally requires. I may need to approach posts like that one in two stages: summary first, then (after a break) argument. Luckily, I’m hoping to retire soon, so I should be able to give more time to Talk about books. I think that ought to solve the problem.</p><p>Henry Oliver’s complaint is primarily about book reviews, though his own publication (which has that rule about no lengthy plot summaries), doesn’t usually carry reviews, but is dedicated to a deeper and more wide-ranging discussion, the kind of thing I’m ideally aiming for in Talk about books.</p><p>I remain largely unperturbed by the decline of the book review. A few years ago, I wrote that <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/book-review-still-dying.html\">the book review was dying</a> — <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/death-of-the-book-review.html\">and we didn’t need to mourn it</a>. I haven’t changed my mind about that.</p><p>Book publicist Kathleen Schmidt recently wrote, in <a href=\"https://kathleenschmidt.substack.com/p/book-publicity-what-works-and-what\">Book publicity: what works and what doesn’t</a>:</p><blockquote>I’d love to write that reviews sell books, but I’d be lying. The correct statement is, “A critical mass of reviews mixed with other media and marketing efforts can sell a book.” I understand why reviews are essential, and I respect book critics. Literary criticism is necessary. However, reviews and book sales don’t often align.</blockquote><p>I get the impression that she finds it regrettable that reviews aren’t as influential or as plentiful as they used to be, but that she’s realistic and clear-sighted about the facts that this is no longer true, and is very unlikely to be again.</p><p>As I’ve said before, I’m inclined to see the eclipse of the book review as an opportunity for the emergence of a less constrained discussion of books: precisely the kind of thing that Henry Oliver has been doing with The Common Reader. In the meantime, I’ll be trying to summarize less and to get more of my analysis down on the page.</p>",

			"title": "Sex, SDAM and aphantasia",
			"content_html": "<p class=\"intro\">This post may contain TMI. Stop reading any time you like, obviously.</p><p>Do you remember what it feels like to have sex? I don’t. In fact, until just a few years ago, the notion that one might <em>remember a feeling</em>, if it had occurred to me at all, would have seemed a category confusion. Feelings or sensations aren’t memorable, I’d have thought, and memories aren’t <em>felt</em>. Memories are cognitive, surely, not affective. It’s not as if they’re directly experienced; they’re more like a conversion of experience (among other things) into a different format, one that can be stored away and recalled. I didn’t begin to suspect that I might be wrong till after — some time after — I found out about aphantasia and SDAM.</p><p>SDAM and aphantasia don’t always coincide or overlap. There are people who can’t form visual mental images, yet can remember, more or less vividly, episodes and incidents that have happened to them. And there are, I understand, people who don’t have vivid episodic memories even though their imaginations are visual. When I first learned of this I wasn’t sure what to make of it. I had been inclined to assume that SDAM and aphantasia were in effect the same thing, given different names because they had been approached from different directions by different teams of researchers. Apparently this isn’t true.</p><p>Nevertheless, though they are different things, it’s not at all uncommon for them to go together. The <a href=\"https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/90427/1/Watkins_%28A%29phantasia%20and%20deficient%20memory_2018.pdf\">paper that persuaded me that there’s a distinction between them</a> was written by a man who has both! (As do I.) So it’s not always easy to distinguish the effects of one from those of the other. Sometimes the effects seem to reinforce each other. When I first concluded that I must have aphantasia, about 5 years ago, I wrote several posts on Medium about the various ways that I thought aphantasia affected my behaviour and my perception of the world around me. I’ve since <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html\">moved those posts to this site</a>. There was one post in particular, titled “<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia/aphantasia-sex-and-gender.html\">Aphantasia, sex and gender</a>”, that I wasn’t satisfied with. It seemed to me to be missing something essential. I always intended to return and look at the topic in more depth but, until now, I haven’t done so.</p><p>Now I think I know what was missing from my earlier post. When I wrote it, I was thinking of aphantasia as primarily affecting the visual imagination. But I learned not long afterwards that I also can’t call to mind tastes, smells or sensations. In comparison, my auditory imagination is not as empty; it’s quite lively and complex. I suppose that’s why I’m much better at recognizing voices than I am with faces — though I’m still not able to distinguish between CD-quality sound and a fairly low bitrate MP3. It took me a long time to realize that it’s a waste of time for me to try to decide which of several different roasts and blends of coffee bean I prefer: I simply can’t remember the tastes or smells of the ones I’ve previously tried.</p><p>Clearly this is an area where aphantasia and SDAM overlap: to say that I can’t <em>imagine</em> what, say, Lavazza’s Il Perfetto Espresso tastes like is effectively the same thing as saying that I don’t <em>remember</em> the taste. It’s for this reason that these days I’m much more inclined to put the emphasis on SDAM rather than aphantasia, though it was aphantasia that first caught my attention.</p><p>So, when I was attempting to write about sex and aphantasia before, I now think I was leaving out of account two important factors: I was concentrating entirely on imagination rather than memory, and I was paying attention only to visual stimuli, without regard to taste, smell or touch. I’m pretty sure it’s uncontroversial to say that smell, taste and touch play an even more important part in the experience of sex than vision does, though that fact seems not to have occurred to me when I was writing my earlier post.</p><p>When I was younger, I often wondered if sex hadn’t been oversold. I mean I liked it, obviously, and I’d certainly rather have it than not, but when people spoke about it, as they often did, in terms of ecstasy and intense pleasure, I’d wonder what I was missing. It occurred to me that maybe I hadn’t been doing it right, and that I might get more pleasure from it as my performance improved with more practice. (It’s possible that I never got enough practice! I mean, what’s “enough”?)</p><p>Obviously, I’m having to speculate, because I’ve no way of directly comparing my own experience to other people’s, but I have been wondering whether much of the pleasure and enjoyment of sex that most people claim to experience derives from their ability to recall and reexperience the feelings or sensations, the smells, the taste — and, of course, the visuals — associated with it. If that’s true, perhaps my vague dissatisfaction with sex results from the fact that, for me, the experience doesn’t leave any traces in the episodic memory. Who knows?</p><p>One of the questions that preoccupied me when I was writing regularly about aphantasia was the extent (if any) to which it <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia/aphantasia-look-like-adhd.html\">resembled ADHD</a> or affected <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia/aphantasia-and-executive-function.html\">executive function</a>. It seemed likely that an inability to visualize could be expected to impair one’s visual working memory. I understand that recent research (to which I don’t have access) suggests that executive function in general is <em>not</em> adversely affected by having aphantasia. Before I heard about this research, however, I read a lot online about ADHD and executive function, and I found that some researchers believe that ADHD is linked to a lack of dopamine.</p><p>That got me wondering whether I’ve ever experienced a dopamine “rush”. Naturally, as you might expect of someone with SDAM, I couldn’t <em>remember</em> having experienced one, or (assuming that I had) what it felt like. So I decided to start paying attention to see if, when I finished a piece of work or accomplished something challenging, I got a little reward in the form of a mood boost. And I did! But it wasn’t very strong and it lasted only a moment or two. In fact, I’d say it would have been barely noticeable if I hadn’t been keeping an eye out for it. I can’t imagine that the prospect of repeating the experience, even if I could remember the feeling, would act as an incentive to try to recapture it by doing the thing again. So, maybe it’s possible that I wasn’t experiencing the “rush” as strongly as most people do.</p><p>I’ve often noticed that I don’t tend to get excited at the prospect of some forthcoming treat, for example attending a concert or similar event. When I’d see other people getting worked up to a pitch of anticipation, I’d react in one of two ways, depending on my mood. Either I’d envy them and wonder how I could emulate their state, or I’d assume they were faking it and wonder how and why. Once I had learned about SDAM and aphantasia, though, I thought I had a more persuasive answer: I wasn’t getting myself into a state of anticipatory agitation because I wasn’t able to imagine the event itself. I couldn’t picture it, so I remained relatively detached. But now, I’ve begun to wonder if dopamine might equally have something to do with it. What if I’m just not getting excited because my dopamine level is lower than average?</p><p>Naturally, I started to Google the terms “SDAM” and “dopamine” together, and I came across this fascinating piece in <cite>Nature</cite>, “<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02211-5\">The forgotten part of memory</a>”. (Sorry, it has disappeared behind a paywall since I originally read it.) It suggests that dopamine is essential to our ability to forget. So maybe that’s it: because of SDAM, I haven’t any difficulty in forgetting episodes from my life — with the result I just don’t need dopamine as much as most people do!</p>",

			"title": "Hugo Grotius and the minimalist theory of natural law",
			"content_html": "<p>More than 20 years ago I started to read the main works of Hugo Grotius. I was writing a thesis about the poet Andrew Marvell, and I wanted to try to clarify Marvell’s references to Grotius, particularly those in “The Character of Holland”, a satire written during the first Anglo-Dutch war. Marvell’s poem refers to two of the Dutchman’s works, <cite>Mare liberum</cite> and <cite>De iure belli ac pacis</cite>, and effectively accuses the United Provinces of acting as if they owned the sea, though their famous theorist had insisted that the sea was incapable of being owned.</p><p>As I read the longer of the two works, I was immediately drawn to a question that seemed to me much more fundamental and of wider applicability than the lawfulness of claiming rights over the sea: the basis, if one could be found, of natural law, assuming that such a thing could be said to exist.</p><p>Theories of natural law hold that humans are subject to some obligations and duties that exist independently of and prior to any “positive” laws, by which is meant laws enacted by human institutions, such as lawmaking bodies or absolute monarchs. For much of human history, natural law theories were based in religion: the law of nature was thought to derive its force and validity from the will (and command) of God. But what happens when we no longer believe in God? Can we still take natural law seriously?</p><p>Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) insisted that positive law was the only kind of law that was binding or enforceable. His opinion has been very influential. In practice, we’re almost all believers in positive law now, most of the time. A lawyer arguing a case, or advising a client on what can or can’t legally be done, will want to be able to point to a statutory provision or a previously decided case to support the argument. There is certainly a wide range of positive law to govern almost any area of human activity that you can think of, and more is regularly being enacted. But what about earlier times, before legislatures were so powerful and so busy? Were there any obligations that were already binding on humans in “a state of nature”?</p><p>I’ve long thought that, if you believe the Nuremberg trials were anything more legitimate than “victors’ justice” — merely the imposition of its will by the prevailing party on the defeated one — you must effectively base that judgment on some idea of natural law, even if you call it something else. Where did that natural law come from?</p><p>The thing I was most excited to discover in Grotius’s writings was a possible answer to that question. I couldn’t imagine writing about Grotius without devoting substantial attention to the theory of natural law. That gave rise to two problems, though. I was writing about the theme of justice in Marvell’s works and, in the particular chapter I was then working on, about “Grotian concepts of justice” in some of his poems, particularly “The Character of Holland”. The issue relevant to that poem was the argument between Grotius and the English lawyer and historian John Selden about ownership of the sea.</p><p>Selden’s and Grotius’s differing views on this topic <em>could</em> be traced back to their ideas about natural law, by way of their contrasting theories as to how private ownership came to exist in the first place. Selden firmly believed that all law emanated from the will of a competent authority, and that the natural law consists of nothing other than God’s command, whereas Grotius believed, as we’ll see, something distinguishable from that. So I had <em>some</em> basis for bringing in a discussion of the differing theories of natural law, particularly as my theme was “justice”. In doing so, though, I’d be straying quite far from Marvell’s poem, which has nothing to say about the bases for the conflicting theories, and is instead concerned to accuse the Dutch of hypocrisy for acting inconsistently with the principles of their own theorist. By widening the discussion to include the theoretical differences between Grotius and Selden, I’d be losing my focus on the subject of Marvell’s poem.</p><p>Then there was the other problem: the conception I had of Grotius’s theory of natural law had been questioned by historians of political thought, who had contested the idea, previously popular among legal theorists in particular, that Grotius had been a more-or-less disinterested philosopher or theoretician of legal principles who effectively founded the field of international law. I I wanted to delve into Grotian thought, I’d have to demonstrate that I was aware of these developments in intellectual history, but to do so meant diverting my attention even further from Marvell’s poem.</p><p>In the end, I put the whole lot in: Selden’s and Grotius’s conflicting ideas of natural law and the law of nations, their different accounts of the origins of property rights, the criticisms of more recent historians of ideas of the more traditional legal historians’ picture of Grotius. It was only after 11 pages of this  stuff that I came to discuss Marvell’s poem. No wonder the examiners of my thesis described it as “uneven”, and suggested that it could have been noticeably shorter. (Mercifully, they didn’t ask for any changes, though.)</p><p>Rereading the chapter recently after a gap of several years, I could see that I should have cut the natural law discussion completely. I could then equally have done without the review of (relatively) recent reassessments of Grotius’s thought, and reduced the comparison of the contrasting theories about the origin of ownership to a more manageable paragraph or two. Unfortunately, I was quite unable to see this at the time. Mistakenly, I thought I couldn’t remove part of the argument without leaving loose threads which would end up unravelling the whole.</p><p>I wanted to say something about the Grotian “minimalist” theory of natural law. Unfortunately, I was able to see that this topic was (a bit) more than tangentially relevant to the argument of my thesis, and I let myself go. It’s clear now that I ought to have written about it separately somewhere else. But at the time I was deep in the middle of my thesis, I didn’t have any other outlets — no blog, for example — and I couldn’t really think about writing a short, self-contained piece.</p><p>In Grotius’s theory, the natural law consists only of those fundamental precepts which are evident to all human beings by virtue of our rational nature (‘Preliminary Discourse’, VIII, <cite>Rights</cite>, pp. 86–7). Those precepts are binding on all people, including those who have a wholly erroneous, or no, idea of God (‘Preliminary Discourse’, XI, <cite>Rights</cite>, pp. 89–90). In other words, the natural law consists of those rules about which any rational being must think “it could not be otherwise”. This law is binding on all humans by virtue of its self-evident necessity, and this is equally true of humans to whom the word of God has never been revealed. Indeed, the law would still be binding even if (something that Grotius admits could not be asserted without the greatest wickedness) there were no God.</p><p>So, Grotius has arguably succeeded in putting forward a basis for law which is both antecedent to positive law and independent of divine command.</p><p>The precepts of natural law include the obligation that people should be bound by their agreements and the obligations that they have assumed towards others. It’s on this principle that the whole edifice of government and systems of law, starting with the law of nations (<span class=\"language\">ius gentium</span>), is founded. Grotius says that the law of nations is based on the (common) will of all, or at least of many, nations. Acknowledging that, the law of nature apart, there is hardly any law that is universally accepted, he notes that the law of nations is thought to differ from one part of the world to another. But broadly speaking, the law of nations is binding on nations because at one time everybody who is subject to it, or their predecessors, agreed to it and they’re obliged to stand by their agreements.</p><p>Richard Tuck describes the Grotian conception of natural law as “minimalist”, a label that is disputed by Johann P Sommerville, who points out that what Grotius has to say on the subject of natural rights is substantially the same as what had already been said by scholastic thinkers such as Suarez and Aquinas. According to Sommerville:</p><blockquote>Suárez, for example, talked of natural law as obvious first principles of nature and reason, and precepts drawn from them by ‘evident necessity.’ Like Suárez and others, Grotius held that the laws of nature were deducible from a few principles, but he did not argue that the conclusions which could be drawn from those principles were minimal in number …</blockquote><details><summary>Sommerville</summary>Johann P. Sommerville, “Selden, Grotius, and the Seventeenth-Century Intellectual Revolution in Moral and Political Theory”, in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson, eds., <cite>Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe</cite> (Yale University Press, 2001), 318–43; 333.</details><p>Grotius of course acknowledged a debt to Suarez and others but claimed to be treating the topic more systematically than those who had gone before, and in particular distinguishing between things that belonged in different categories. By recategorizing some things (notably rights of ownership) that had previously been considered part of the natural law as instead belonging to the law of nations, he undoubtedly reduced the scope of the former. It’s also true that the incomplete enumeration he attempted of the precepts of natural law has every appearance of minimalism:</p><blockquote>… to which belongs the Abstaining from that which is another’s, and the Restitution of what we have of another’s, or of the profit we have made by it, the Obligation of fulfilling Promises, the Reparation of a Damage done through our own Default, and the Merit of Punishment among Men’ (‘Preliminary Discourse’, VIII, <cite>Rights</cite>, p. 86).</blockquote><details><summary>Grotius, Rights</summary>Hugo Grotius, <cite>The Rights of War and Peace</cite>, ed. Richard Tuck (Liberty Fund, 2005), referred to as “<cite>Rights</cite>” throughout this post.</details><p>I think it’s fair to summarize the broad general argument of the historians of ideas and/or political thought as saying that Grotius wasn’t the conscious and intentional innovator that he was often taken to be, particularly by credulous lawyers who didn’t know their history as well as they thought. No doubt some of those enthusiastic followers overlooked the degree to which his work is based on existing traditions, both scholastic and jurisprudential. But there’s plenty of evidence in the writings themselves that he believed he was doing something new, and it’s objectively true that something new emerged from his works, whatever may have been his intentions: the world now had a theory of natural law that did not depend on the will, the command, or even the existence of God.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>I spent an afternoon 2½ years ago in my sister’s attic near Toulouse, deciding <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/books-left-behind.html\">which of the books I had left there 9 years earlier I wanted to take back to Ireland and which I was prepared to abandon forever</a>. The second group was much the larger, and I told my sister that she was welcome to do whatever she liked with them. Towards the end of last year, she let me know that they were still there, so I decided to go back and take a second bite at the cherry. Partly because of <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/subscribe\">Talk about books</a>, my priorities had changed: there were several books that I had been happy to leave behind before but that I now thought would be worth keeping after all. This time, I’d spend more than an afternoon going through the pile. I went for a week’s visit.</p><p>I quickly confirmed my suspicion that I had missed a box last time. Several books turned up that I had failed to find in 2020: my paperback copy of <cite>Ulysses</cite>, the first two of Kate Atkinson’s Jackson Brodie series, Candia McWilliam’s three novels, Steven Pinker’s <cite>The Blank Slate</cite>, Dibdin’s <cite>Dead Lagoon</cite> (which I had since replaced while <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/after-all-zen-was-just-a-policeman\">writing about his Aurelio Zen series</a>). I packed all of these. As I was inevitably going to take <cite>Ulysses</cite>, I decided that <cite>A Portrait of the Artist</cite> should come too, though I had intentionally left it behind the previous time.</p><p>But if I had found the box that was missing the first time, it seemed that a different one was eluding me now. I couldn’t find the Richard Tuck edition of Grotius, <cite>The Rights of War and Peace</cite> though I’m quite sure I’d seen the 3 hefty volumes when I was last there. If I had found them, would I have wanted to keep them? On the one hand, they had been quite expensive; on the other, I could probably get along without them very well. As it turns out, I don’t need to make up my mind about that.</p><p>In 2020, I had brought back only one Wilkie Collins, namely <cite>Armadale</cite>. This time, I added <cite>Basil</cite>, <cite>The Law and the Lady</cite> and <cite>The Moonstone</cite>; but where were <cite>No Name</cite> and <cite>The Woman in White</cite>? I had decided beforehand that I was going to take most of the Penguin Classics and Oxford World Classics that I’d come across, particularly if they were from the 19th century. So I got a few by Dickens and Austen: <cite>Little Dorrit</cite>, <cite>Our Mutual Friend</cite> and (I think — it certainly should have been there) <cite>Bleak House</cite>; <cite>Emma</cite> and <cite>Persuasion</cite> and (almost certainly) <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>.</p><p>There was no Hardy, though I had been expecting to find a copy of <cite>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</cite> at least. Something else I had been expecting to see but didn’t was the Penguin Classics <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite> introduced by Christopher Ricks. I’ve never got very far into it before, but I think I might be ready for it now. Oh, well.</p><p>I knew in advance that I wasn’t going to want any Lawrence. Nor did I pack any Conrad (where was <cite>Nostromo</cite>?) or (as far as I can remember) Woolf; and the only Kipling I took was <cite>Plain Tales from the Hills</cite>, though I hesitated over <cite>Kim</cite>. (The Penguin Modern Classics covers are hard to resist.)</p><p>Last time, I had been glad to recover William Empson’s <cite>Collected Poems</cite> but had deliberately restricted myself to two volumes of his criticism, <cite>Seven Types of Ambiguity</cite> and <cite>Milton’s God</cite>. (I already had <cite>Using Biography</cite> in Ireland.) This time around, I put aside all the others I could find, intending to go through them to see if there was anything I couldn’t bear to be without. In the end, I didn’t bother to go through them, but packed them all: <cite>Some Versions of Pastoral</cite>, <cite>The Structure of Complex Words</cite>, <cite>Argufying</cite> and the first volume of <cite>Essays on Renaissance Literature</cite>. The second volume of <cite>Essays on Renaissance Literature</cite> must be in the “missing” box.</p><p>There were a few other individual books that I had specifically decided against taking last time, and about which I had second thoughts: Ian McEwan’s <cite>Atonement</cite> and Zadie Smith’s <cite>White Teeth</cite> being the most obvious examples. I had taken everything else by McEwan that I could find, so so it seemed a bit odd not to take <cite>Atonement</cite> too.</p><p>The books are in 4 small boxes under a table in my sister’s séjour, awaiting collection (with <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/bringing-back-cd.html\">a 5th full of CDs</a>). They ought (among other things), to fuel Talk about books for some time to come.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>I’ve just got home having spent a week in France visiting my youngest sister and her family. The last time I was there was 2½ years ago, when I spent an afternoon sorting through <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/books-left-behind.html\">the books I’d left behind in 2011</a>, to see which ones I wanted to keep. At that time, I told my sister that she was welcome to throw out the rest, or dispose of them however she saw fit. She didn’t in fact get rid of any of them in the meantime, but eventually moved them out of the attic to the terrace, where they were slightly more vulnerable to damp. So, this time, I spent rather more than an afternoon sorting through them again, and salvaging four small boxes worth: partly because of <a href=https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net>Talk about books</a>, my priorities have changed, and there were many books which I had happily abandoned in 2020 that I now thought I’d like to keep after all. I’m going to write about them, probably next weekend. First, though, I want to write about something else I thought I might have left behind for good: my CD collection.</p><p>Along with the books and some other odds and ends, when I left France in 2011 to return to Ireland, there were two substantial boxes of CDs. I had long since ripped all except a handful of them to an iTunes library stored on an external hard drive so I didn’t have many qualms about leaving the CDs behind. As well as the iTunes library, I had a succession of iPods, Walkmans and phones. Back in Ireland, I continued to buy physical CDs and download albums more or less indiscriminately. Most of the time, I didn’t have a CD player, so I invariably ripped the CDs and listened to the music on a variety of devices. Around 2017, after I’d bought the 4-CD set, Brad Mehldau, <cite>10 Years Solo Live</cite>, I decided to rationalize my practice and buy only downloads from then on.</p><p>That habit lasted until 2020, when <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/music-distribution-formats.html\">I wanted to buy Chick Corea’s Vigilette album</a>, <cite>Tempus Fugit</cite>, which wasn’t available as a download. Gradually I started to buy CDs again. I even bought a CD player and began to listen to the CDs directly, rather than to the copies on my external hard drive or iPod Touch.</p><p>I should stress that as far as I’m concerned this isn’t a question of sound quality. I’m a music lover, not an audiophile, and I’m not able to distinguish aurally between the iTunes AAC or MP3 copies and the CD originals. I prefer to listen to the CD because I like the physical reminder that I have a particular album in my collection. In the case of a box set, like the Mehldau solo live album, I <em>like</em> having to change the disc rather than let the almost 5 hours of music play though continuously, as they do on iTunes/Apple Music. And, of course, I like having the liner notes in printed format.</p><p>So naturally I thought that while I was bringing home several boxes of books, I might as well see if I could fit in most of the CDs too. It was clear that this would be a less daunting prospect if I didn’t have to transport the “jewel” cases as well. About half of the CDs are in digipak or similar card packaging. I left those as they are. For the others, I kept the disc, liner notes and any other inserts and dumped the boxes themselves. I did this even in the case of the many CamJazz CDs in the collection (Enrico Pieranunzi, John Taylor, Martial Solal and others), though CamJazz use an unusually robust and appealing type of box. Getting rid of the boxes reduced the weight and bulk of the discs substantially. What used to take up two large boxes now occupies one small one. Of course this will destroy any resale value of the discs, but I’d be surprised if they had any to begin with.</p><p>I’m going to try to find some of the card CD sleeves that used to be common, and glue the liner notes to them. I often thought about doing this years ago, so that the CDs would take up much less space, but I suppose I didn’t have the incentive to do so until I faced the prospect of paying to have them moved from one country to another. I’m looking forward to playing them again after a gap of almost 12 years.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>Towards the end of 2021, when Talk about books was one year old, I thought about starting <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-print-edition\">a print edition</a> of the publication</a> (which, at the time, <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-no-longer.html\">I was still calling a newsletter</a>). In the event, I did something completely different: <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/substack-farewell.html\">I moved Talk about books from Substack, its original home, to Micro.blog</a>, which had just begun to offer a newsletter feature. Now, a year on from that, I’ve revived the idea of a print edition.</p><p>As I said in the original post, I think it’s likely that I won’t find anybody who is willing to pay to receive a printed edition of Talk about books. If that’s the case, I’m not going to be surprised or disappointed: it’s important to me that a physical, tangible edition should exist, and be available to readers, even if nobody takes up the option. If there are no takers, it won’t cost me anything to produce, and if there’s just a handful, the costs will be proportionately small.</p><p>When I was originally thinking about this I intended to use Substack’s paid subscription feature to collect payment for the print option. Now that Talk about books is no longer on Substack I need to find an alternative method.</p><p>I’m planning to offer three tiers: at the top, the printed publication. On average, this will consist of 16–20 A5 pages (four or five A4 sheets folded into a booklet), and contain a little over 2,000 words on average. The cost will be €12 per month and there will be 26 issues a year.</p><p>The middle tier will consist of the A5 PDF, exactly the same as the printed edition except that the pages will be in the right order for reading on screen (rather than for printing on both sides of A4 sheets). That will be sent by email and will cost €3 per month or €30 a year.</p><p>The third tier will, of course, be exactly what we have at the moment: each post sent by email and RSS, and archived on the web at <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/tabarchive\">https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/tabarchive</a>. It will remain free to read, as it has been since the start.</p><p>I’m going to treat the next Talk about books post, on 11-Jan-2023, as a test run, to try to gauge interest. The screen PDF (i.e. the middle tier) will be free to download, and there’ll be a link to it in the usual email. And if you’ll send me €6 and your postal address, I’ll mail you a printed copy.</p><p>The money can be sent by PayPal to <a href=\"mailto:art@talkaboutbooks.net\">art@talkaboutbooks.net</a>, which is also where you can send the postal address and any comments or suggestions you might have (whether or not you want a printed copy). I’m looking forward to hearing from you.</p><p>You can sign up for the email posts (which are free, and sent out every two weeks) here:</p><form method=\"POST\" action=\"https://micro.blog/users/subscribe/5102\">  <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" size=\"30\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" />   <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\" /></form><p>Or <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/categories/newsletter/feed.xml\">get the RSS feed here</a>.",

			"content_html": "<p>It’s a truism that collections of short stories are a hard sell. Publishers are reluctant to take them because they know there’s a good chance that readers won’t be willing to buy them. I tended to think of this as simply the way things are, without really wondering why it should be so. It’s for that reason that I had a kind of an “aha!” moment in April 2018, when I saw a tweet from Sinéad Gleeson, the editor of <cite>The Long Gaze Back</cite>, a collection of short stories by Irish women. Gleeson quoted Mavis Gallant, who wrote in the Preface to her 1950 <cite>Collected Stories</cite>:</p><blockquote>Stories are not chapters of novels. They should not be read one after another, as if they were meant to follow along. Read one. Shut the book. Read something else. Come back later. Stories can wait.</blockquote><p>If story collections are not to be read as though they were novels, perhaps an approximately novel-length volume in which the stories are listed like chapters is not the best delivery mechanism for them. What is that volume, after all, but an invitation to the reader to read them in sequence, one leading on to the next, in about the same time as it would take her to read a novel? Does <em>that</em> explain why readers, and therefore publishers, are wary of the collection? Because the reader knows from experience that the volume is likely to remain unfinished, unreturned-to, a long-standing reproach?</p><p>The preceding paragraphs originally formed part of a post I wrote back in 2018 about where to read short stories online. The rest of the post is long out of date and I deleted it at least 18 months ago. But last weekend, in the last Talk about books post of 2022, I was writing about short stories and I’d have liked to include a link to these paragraphs, so I thought I’d resurrect them as a short, standalone post.</p><p>And, as we’re on the subject of reading short stories online, <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-stories-online.html\">here’s my too seldom updated list</a>.</p>",

			"title": "Why I don’t trust Bookshop.org",
			"content_html": "<p>I haven’t always been convinced that independent bookshops are a vital part of our culture. <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/who-needs-independent-booksellers.html\">I wrote about my ambivalence two years ago</a>. I was already leaning steeply towards the view that indie booksellers are necessary, they’re under threat and we need to do whatever we can to keep them in business. In the two years since, I’ve come down firmly on that side.</p><p>The threat still comes from Amazon, who still dominate the market for books and act like a ruthless predator in that market and others. In my earlier post, I didn’t mention Bookshop.org, a company which positions itself as the antidote to Amazon. I may not have heard of it at the time, as its operations were confined to the United States then. It opened a UK division at the end of 2020. If I had heard of it, I probably hadn’t looked closely at its method of carrying out those operations.</p><p>Bookshop.org says <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/pages/about\">its mission is “to financially support local, independent bookshops”</a>. The way it goes about doing this is a bit surprising. When you buy a book through Bookshop.org the order goes from that website straight to the book wholesaler (that’s <a href=\"https://www.gardners.com/\">Gardners</a> in the UK) who dispatch it to you. The actual independent local bookshop isn’t directly involved in the transaction and the book doesn’t come out of its own stock. In fact, it doesn’t even see the book. However, when you visited the Bookshop.org site, you were asked to choose a bookshop and then brought to the “virtual storefront” of your choice. If you ordered the book through that virtual storefront, the corresponding bookseller will get a 30% cut of the book’s price. The independent bookseller is not a necessary part of this system. There’s something obviously artificial about its involvement.</p><p>The 30% that Bookshop.org pays is less than a bookseller would normally get from a book sold directly in their physical shop. According to <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/12/bookshoporg-independent-bookshops-andy-hunter-waterstones\">this New Statesman story</a>, they would usually expect between 42% and 50% of the price. In that case, though, the bookseller would have to order and stock the book and make place for it on their shelves. In the case of the Bookshop.org sale, they don’t have to do any of that, so arguably the smaller percentage is a fair cut.</p><p>The New Statesman piece, which appeared only a month after Bookshop.org opened in the UK, and might not reflect the present position, suggests that Bookshop.org may not so much be taking customers away from Amazon as drawing them from the very bookshops it’s supposed to be supporting. Is it possible that the people buying through Bookshop.org are largely the people who would otherwise have bought the book over the counter in a physical shop?</p><p>What bothers me is that a system whose professed aim is to help independent bookstores looks more like a practical demonstration of their supposed irrelevance. The Bookshop.org system would work just fine without any independent booksellers at all. If the economics of this business model ever become unworkable, the indie bookshops’ 30% is likely to be the first cost to be cut. I shouldn’t be surprised if Bookshop.org ends up doing more harm than good to independent booksellers.</p><p>I haven’t bought anything through Bookshop.org myself. I no longer live in the UK, and I don’t particularly want to test whether the wholesalers will post to Ireland. More importantly, I suspect that there are more effective ways to support independent local bookshops. I now live 11 Km from Westport, in County Mayo. That town has at least four bookshops that I can think of off the top of my head, including the inviting <a href=\"https://tertuliabookshop.com/\">Tertulia</a>. Castlebar, just a little further away, has the excellent Castle Books. Even the small town of Louisburgh is well served by <a href=\"https://www.booksatone.ie/louisburgh/\">Books at One</a> (pictured). I’ve been to Galway four or five times this year and bought books in several shops there.</p><img src=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/images/booksatone-small.jpeg\" alt=\"Books at One, Louisburgh, County Mayo\", width=\"640\" height=\"725\" /> <p>If I can’t immediately find a book that I want in a local shop, I tend to look online first at <a href=\"https://kennys.ie/\">Kennys</a> in Galway. In the past, if I still couldn’t find the book on Kennys’ site, I’d try <a href=\"https://www.alibris.co.uk/\">Alibris</a>, though I’ve been avoiding them recently for reasons that are not directly relevant to the subject of this post.</p><p>In practical terms, I suppose my opinion doesn’t count for much. I live in a place that isn’t covered by Bookshop.org and that <em>is</em> well served by a choice of independent bookshops. But it bothers me that an initiative that has been hailed as great news for booksellers may not in the end turn out to be as effective as has been suggested.</p>",

			"title": "Mistaken long: Andrew Marvell and pronouns again",
			"content_html": "<p>I’ve been familiar with Andrew Marvell’s poem, “The Garden”, for a long time. I first encountered it in the early 1970s when I was at school. I was entranced by the ideas of the mind as an “ocean where each kind | Does straight its own resemblance find,” (ll. 43–4) and the soul which “Casting the body’s vest aside” (l. 51) glides into the boughs of the trees to prepare “for longer flight” (l. 55). But I forgot about the poem and rediscovered it with delight twenty years later when I went back to college in my thirties to study English (having done Law the first time around). I eventually wrote my doctoral thesis on Marvell; and it was “The Garden” that first hooked me on his poetry.</p><p>So, it’s a poem that I’m quite familiar with, and I’m embarrassed to have to admit that there’s something obvious about it that I had never noticed until last week. The second stanza begins:</p><blockquote>Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,<br>And Innocence, thy sister dear!<br>Mistaken long, I sought you then<br>In busy companies of men. (ll. 9–12)</blockquote><p>I had often noticed the shift from “thee” and “thy” in the first two lines of this stanza, to “you” in the third, but I had never before paid attention to the reason for this shift. Suddenly it struck me that “you” is — of course! — plural: the speaker is no longer speaking to, and about, “Fair Quiet” alone, but Quiet and Innocence together. Not only had he formerly been seeking Quiet “in busy companies of men”, he’d also been looking for Innocence in all the same wrong places! He had not only been long mistaken, but doubly so.</p><p>We’re now accustomed to the singular use of “you”, so it was easy for me to assume that the speaker continued, as he had started, to address a single listener. Now that I’ve seen my error, I think I ought to search through Marvell’s works to see whether he <em>ever</em> uses “you” as a singular pronoun and, if so, in what circumstances.</p><p>One of the arguments in favour of “the singular they” is that a similar change in number had happened in the case of “you”, without that causing confusion or difficulty. Before that change, “thou”, “thee” and “thy” were used informally and between equals, while “you” and “your” indicated that one was speaking either to more than one person, or to an individual who deserved or required respect or deference. As we know, “thou” became archaic and now everybody is “you”, however many or few they are.</p><p>But it’s not really true, is it, that the singularization of “you” came about without any confusion or misunderstanding? It often seems to me that we’re constantly looking to reintroduce a distinctively plural version of the second person pronoun. My father used to say “you people” to make it clear that he was addressing us collectively, not individually. When I lived in Dublin in the late 70s and early 80s, it wasn’t unusual to hear “yous” performing the same function. I went through a phase of using it myself. And, of course, there’s “y’all”.</p><p>In short, I think there’s clearly some value in retaining a distinction between singular and plural pronouns. I’m not, of course, advocating that we bring back “thou”. But I expect that if (when?) use of the singular they becomes the norm, we’re likely to see determined attempts to distinguish the plural from it. “They-all” perhaps. Or “theys”?</p>",

We are part of a seismic shift in the <em>media economy</em> that is all about writer and creator ownership and independence.</blockquote><p>The idea, he says, is to put writers in control of their own work and in direct contact with their readers, and email newsletters are just a part of the process.</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/\">Talk about books</a> was originally on Substack, where I started it just under 2 years ago. In December 2021 Manton Reece, founder of Micro.blog, <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2021/12/06/introducing-email-newsletter.html\">introduced a newsletter feature there</a>. I was keen to try that out, so <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/substack-farewell.html\">I switched over from Substack</a>.</p><p>So, though Talk about books is no longer on Substack, I feel that McKenzie’s observations have some application to it. The fact is that I’ve been feeling uncomfortable calling it a <em>news</em>letter and referring to the individual posts as “issues”. For a start, it doesn’t contain any “news”, just book discussion. I feel as if McKenzie’s post has given me permission to stop thinking and writing about it in those terms.</p><p>I’m not sure what I should call it instead, though. I’m thinking of “email letter”. As against that, it’s also distributed as an RSS feed and each “issue” originates as a post on Micro.blog. I tend to think of it as a web publication, with the emails being just one way of notifying people about it.</p><p>McKenzie is keen to emphasize that the email newsletter has from the start being just one aspect of what Substack offers. They quickly introduced their own web-based Reader (in effect a new RSS reader) and more recently a mobile app (to which a chat feature has just been added). They also have podcasts and video. RSS apart, none of that really interests me, so I’ve been thinking about what additional features I could offer to supplement the fortnightly email.</p><p>Before Manton and Micro.blog tempted me away from Substack, I had been thinking of offering a physical, <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-print-edition\">printed copy of the letter by post</a>. When I decided to shift everything over to Micro.blog I shelved that idea because I had to set up and test new Micro.blog templates and separate styles for the emails and the web posts. You probably noticed that was a bit hit and miss for a while, but I’ve now got it as close to the way I want it as email will permit.</p><p>Now I think it might be time to resuscitate the printed letter idea. The next Talk about books post, scheduled for 16 November, will be the last of Talk about books’s second year, so it seems an opportune time to think about new directions. As I said <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-print-edition\">a year ago</a>, I think it’s entirely possible (actually likely) that nobody will want to pay for a printed version. In that case, it won’t cost me anything to produce it, so no harm done, but I feel that it’s important at least to <em>offer</em> the printed option, even if there are no takers.</p><p>Of course, since I’m no longer on Substack, managing the paid subscription element would be more complicated than I originally envisaged, so that’s another complication I’ll need to consider.</p>",
