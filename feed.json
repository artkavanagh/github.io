			"content_html": "<p>During the first year of my newsletter, Talk about books, I posted updates here at roughly quarterly intervals (every 6 or 7 issues) summing up what I’d been posting and giving an indication of my intentions for the months coming up. I’ve just posted the seventh issue of the second year. These are the titles and topics of my posts since <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/newsletter-year-already.html\">the last update</a>:</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/2022/02/23/a-villain-not.html\">“A villain not to be forsworn”: <cite>The Revenger’s Tragedy</cite></a><br>A malcontent who is prepared to commit multiple murders to avenge the death of his betrothed, persists in an attempt to corrupt his own sister, with their mother’s help, rather than break his oath. Why does he value his oath above many lives, including his own?</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/2022/02/09/an-exemplary-case.html\">“An exemplary case of unacknowledged self-persuasion”: Ian McEwan, <cite>Enduring Love</cite></a><br>Ian McEwan’s 1997 novel is (apart from a few chapters) the first-person narrative of Joe Rose, a successful science journalist and popularizer of scientific topics from dinosaurs to quantum mechanics, who suffers a crisis when he finds himself unwittingly taking part in an accidental but fatal “game” of Prisoner’s Dilemma.</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/2022/01/19/an-infant-in.html\">An infant in its cradle: William Blake’s prophetic serial killers</a>: Michael Dibdin, <cite>Dark Spectre</cite><br>Dibdin’s first US-set novel, Dark Spectre (1995), features a group of serial killers who believe they’re inspired by William Blake. But the resemblances to Francis Dolarhyde are mostly superficial. Is Dibdin’s novel a critique of Thomas Harris’s?</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/2022/01/05/youve-got-a.html\">You’ve got a right to be angry: Salman Rushdie, <cite>Fury</cite></a><br>Like some of his earlier fiction, notably <cite>Midnight’s Children</cite>, Salman Rushdie’s novel <cite>Fury</cite> (2001) is driven by anger. But it’s a more diffuse, less directed anger than in the earlier novel. Something has changed.</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/2021/12/22/talk-about-books.html\">Peter Abrahams’s impaired heroes</a>: <cite>Oblivion</cite>, <cite>Nerve Damage</cite> and <cite>Delusion</cite><br>Three novels from the mid 2000s by Stephen King’s “favorite American suspense novelist”, featuring protagonists who have the odds stacked against them, even more so than is usual in suspense fiction.</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/andrew-marvell-a-dialogue-between\">Andrew Marvell, “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body”</a>: “Mine own precipice I go”<br>Marvell shows the two different parts of the human individual complaining bitterly about each other. But they are more alike, and more deeply interdependent, than either will admit.</p><p><a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/after-all-zen-was-just-a-policeman\">“After all, Zen was just a policeman”</a>: The moral trajectory of Michael Dibdin’s Venetian detective<br>If you don’t read Michael Dibdin’s Aurelio Zen books in order, you might think the detective is an unusually inconsistent series character. But he gradually becomes less law-abiding from book to book, over the first 8 novels in the series.</p><p>Shortly after I posted the Marvell issue, Manton Reece, the creator of Micro.blog, introduced a newsletter feature and <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/substack-farewell.html\">I decided to move “Talk about books” there from Substack</a>. The move ran into some glitches but I’m pleased with the result.</p><p>I’ve sketched out my rough plans up to the end of June. They include the first (and maybe second) of a number of posts about spy fiction; more discussion of short stories (not all of them Irish this time); a look at Ishiguro’s novel <cite>The Buried Giant</cite>; and prison and prisoners in Peter Abrahams’s novels. The next issue (unless I get distracted by something else in the meantime) will be about the two middle books in Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series, <cite>Faithful Place</cite> and <cite>Broken Harbour</cite>.</p><p>If this sounds like your kind of thing and you haven’t already signed up for the email newsletter, you can do so here:</p><form method=\"POST\" action=\"https://micro.blog/users/subscribe/5102\">  <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" size=\"30\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" />   <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\" /></form><p>If you’d prefer to follow by RSS, <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/categories/newsletter/feed.xml\">this is where you’ll find the feed</a>.</p>",

			"title": "Adding a description to a Micro.blog post, using Hugo",
			"content_html": "<p>I’ve been wanting to add a description to my longer posts on Micro.blog. I recently set up my newsletter preferences so that posts with titles are by default sent out to newsletter subscribers. I wanted a description (which would be different from the automatically generated <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/\">Summary</a>) to be used in Twitter cards — and ideally also in an automatically generated archive of newsletter posts (which I have still to work on). It could also be added to the head of each post in a meta “description” tag, which would show up in certain search results.</p><p>Micro.blog is based on a static site generator named Hugo, which is powerful and complicated. I knew that Hugo is capable of doing what I want, but I wasn’t sure that I would be capable of <em>getting</em> it to do so. Until a few weeks ago, I had no experience of using Hugo, and I’ve been finding recently that, as I get older, I’m becoming increasingly resistant to learning new tech tricks. But this seemed like it might be worth pursuing, so long as it didn’t take up too much of my time.</p><p>In the end, it took longer than it should have, and than I’d have liked. Essentially, the idea was that, as I posted each issue of the newsletter, I’d add both the post title and a shortish description to a JSON file, &quot;postlist.json&quot;, in the /data/ folder of my micro.blog. I’d add some lines to the &quot;head&quot; template which would cause Hugo to open the JSON file and loop though the various entries, looking for a title that matched that of the post. On finding a match, it would add  a meta tag to the html file for the post, containing the corresponding description.</p><p>It sounds simple enough, because it is, but only for people who know what they’re doing. My problem was that, till it actually started to work, I wasn’t sure I was taking the right approach. I’m sure that Hugo’s error messages are highly informative to someone who understands the system but they’re opaque and intimidating to someone who doesn’t. Eventually, I worked out that I couldn’t simply compare the post title in my data file with the Title of the post: first, I had to convert the latter to a string. There were a few other little hitches of that nature.</p><p>As of now, my data file has just two entries. It looks like this:</p><a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/micro-blog-description-hugo.html\">More …</a></p>",

			"title": "Marvell and Mortalism: A supplementary note to my essay on “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body”",
			"content_html": "<p>The subject of <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/andrew-marvell-a-dialogue-between\">the most recent issue of my newsletter</a>, “Talk about books”, is Andrew Marvell’s 44-line lyric poem, “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body”. The poem shows the two parties to the dialogue in apparent opposition to each other: each complains that the other makes its existence unbearable. If they’re telling the truth, their coexistence would be virtually impossible. I argue that, on the contrary, their dispute shows how interdependent — and in some respects how indistinguishable — they are.</p><p>My original plan for the piece was to attempt to relate Marvell’s dialogue to the doctrine of Mortalism. Mortalism was the belief that the soul could not survive the death of the body, but that both lived and died together. They were not, in other words, distinct or separable parts of the human being but really no more than different ways of apprehending different aspects of that being.</p><p>This doctrine was rejected and proscribed by such very different figures and bodies as Jean Calvin (McDowell, p. 570), Pope Leo X (p. 566) and the English Parliament in 1648 (p. 572). Several of the main churches of the time considered it heretical. Yet, as Nicholas McDowell shows, it was really no more than mildly heterodox in its implications. It didn’t prevent its adherents from believing in the Resurrection: but that would not be the resurrection <em>of the body</em> alone, but of body and soul together. The soul would not be alive during the interval between the death of the body and the Last Judgment. According to this belief, there are at present no humans in hell, but that is not a state of affairs that will persist beyond the Day of Judgment.</p><details><summary>Note: McDowell</summary>Nicholas McDowell, “Dead Souls and Modern Minds? Mortalism and the early modern imagination, from Marlowe to Milton, <cite>Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies</cite>, 40(3), 559–592.</details><p>Mortalism was one of several heretical or unorthodox beliefs held by Marvell’s friend John Milton. (Milton was also an Arian who believed that Jesus was not coeternal or of one being with God the Father, and an Arminian, maintaining that humans have free will to accept or reject God’s grace.) In <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/finite-though-unbounded\">my essay on William Empson’s poetry</a>, I cite the passage on Mortalism from <cite>Milton’s God</cite> (revised edition, 1965, pp. 201–2) and conclude:</p><blockquote>Milton may have believed that the majority of human beings are destined to suffer never-ending punishment, but at least he did not see us as irresolvably contradictory creatures whose two incompatible parts are forever in conflict.</blockquote><p>If my reading of “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body” is right, one might say that neither does that poem see us as irresolvably contradictory creatures whose two incompatible parts are forever in conflict. So, does that make Marvell a mortalist?</p><p>I doubt very much if that question can reliably be answered: when it comes to religion, we don’t know for sure what Marvell believed. He was cautious and reserved on the subject and, as someone who was sharply conscious of the fact that he had enemies, he had reason to be circumspect. I’ve touched on certain aspects of his religious belief in “<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/religion-theodicy.html\">Religion and divine justice in the work of Andrew Marvell</a>”, and I don’t expect to have anything to add in the future to what I wrote there. (Nicholas von Maltzahn’s “Milton, Marvell and Toleration” is very good on the subject.)</p><details><summary>Note: von Maltzahn</summary>Nicholas von Maltzahn, “Milton, Marvell and Toleration”, in Sharon Achinstein and Elizabeth Sauer, eds. <cite>Milton and Toleration</cite>, (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 86–104, especially at pp. 92–6).</details><p>While writing about Marvell’s “Dialogue” for my newsletter, I came to understand that I don’t want to treat the poem as historical evidence for Marvell’s adherence to or dissent from this or that doctrine. Rather, I was trying to arrive at as good — accurate, persuasive — a reading of the poem as I was able to. To me, that’s not a scholarly historical exercise but rather a critical one.</p><p>I long ago accepted (having resisted at first) that scholarly historical work is both necessary and much more valuable than the kind of critical, interpretive approach that I prefer. But that’s not to say that the criticism and interpretation are completely without value. I delayed writing about “A Dialogue between the Soul and Body” because I thought I could so so only if I managed to situate it in the context of seventeenth century English Christian belief in general, and Marvell’s in particular.</p><p>In the end, I realized that, if I were going to write about it at all, it would have to be simply as a poem, not as a historical document or piece of evidence. At the same time, I didn’t want to obscure the fact that reading the poem had led me to speculate as to what Marvell believed about the (im)mortality of the soul. I thought it better to make this clear in a note separate from the essay itself.</p>",

			"title": "Substack farewell: “Talk about books” is moving",
			"content_html": "<p>Talk about books started out on Substack and spent the first year of its existence there. Less than a week ago, I had no intention of moving it from there. Then, Manton Reece, the founder of Micro.blog, surprised us all when <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2021/12/06/introducing-email-newsletter.html\">he announced</a> that Micro.blog was introducing an email newsletter feature.</p><p>I’ve been using Micro.blog for a little over 3 years now. I signed up for it first as an alternative to Twitter, a role it fills very well. It’s not simply a Twitter clone, though: it’s a lot more flexibile and versatile. In fact, it’s a full blogging platform, though with the emphasis on microblogging. (I talk about my use of Micro.blog on <a href=\"https://monday.micro.blog/2021/11/29/art-aka-artkavanagh.html\">a recent episode of the Micro Monday podcast</a>, with Jean McDonald.) Manton has been steadily adding features, including Bookshelves, which <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/bookshelf\">I just started to use recently</a>.</p><p>I’ve got a lot of use and enjoyment out of Micro.blog over the past 3 years, and I’ve recently been devoting a lot of my attention to Talk about books, so I was excited by the news that it would now be possible to combine the two. Even so, the decision to move Talk about books from Substack was far from being a no-brainer.</p><p>I’ve considered moving from Substack before, probably to <a href=\"https://buttondown.email\">Buttondown</a>, but till now have always decided to stay put. Substack doesn’t give me a lot of control over the look and feel of the newsletter, but it gives me enough. The available options, limited though they are, look slick and save me from wasting a lot of time in foostering and tinkering.</p><p>There are certainly some disadvantages to the move. I was previously able to keep the domain name for the newsletter (talkaboutbooks.net) separate from that for my microblog (micro.artkavanagh.ie). If I wanted to maintain the distinction, I’d have to start a second blog on Micro.blog and my cost would triple from $5 a month to $15. So, I decided to let micro.artkavanagh.ie fall by the wayside, and combine my microblogging and newsletter under one domain, just doubling my monthly payment to $10. We’ll see how that goes: there’s always the option of starting a second blog later.</p><p>The other main disadvantage is that I’ll have to move the existing subscribers to Talk about books over to Micro.blog, and it’s almost inevitable that I’ll lose some of them in the process, as they’ll be asked to confirm their “new” subscriptions. I’ll admit that that made me think twice. In the end, though, I reminded myself that I have no particular reason to want to retain subscribers who stay signed up only out of inertia.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some good reasons in support of the move. Substack offers writers a pretty good deal at the moment, but it has accepted venture capitalist funding, which may in future mean that it comes under pressure to produce the kind of return on investment that venture capitalists expect. (Some people believe that that’s what went wrong with Patreon.)</p><p>Some of my concerns are minor, not dealbreakers in themselves, but cumulative in their effects. For a start, I feel a bit odd being on the same platform as so many advocates for blockchain, cryptocurrency and NFTs. I’ve written before about <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/cite-markup.html\">not being able to use html &lt;cite&gt; tags on Substack</a>. It’s really not a big deal, but …</p><p>In principle, I like the idea of using upright (not italic) letters for book and journal titles, but it’s not normal practice, and since html <em>does</em> provide the appropriate inline element, I feel that it ought to be used. When I moved a lot of book-related posts from Medium to this site a few months ago, I went through them marking up the titles with &lt;cite&gt;s. I have to admit it made me feel better. Now my newsletter will have properly marked-up book titles too.</p>",

			"title": "Literal.club is an interesting app/site, but it’s not for me",
			"content_html": "<p>Just over a week ago I stopped using <a href=\"https://literal.club\">Literal.club</a>, a site and app that helps members to track their reading. I had joined in late September and been using it for two months. It’s a bit like a smaller, friendlier alternative to Goodreads, and my impression is that many people who have recently joined Literal did so because they were fed up with Goodreads and were looking for a substitute. That’s not my story — not quite. I stopped being <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/Goodreads-self-published-author.html\">an active user of Goodreads</a> 3½ years ago, and finally deleted my inactive account the following year.</p><p>As for Goodreads substitutes, I tried out <a href=\"https://www.litsy.com/\">Litsy</a> for a few months in 2018, but soon came to the conclusion that I wasn’t getting much from it, and that it was more trouble than it was worth. So, long before Literal came along, I’d discovered that I don’t need a Goodreads alternative, and that I’m probably happier without one. But I decided to try it anyway because, well, I like trying new things.</p><p>Literal has a much cleaner, lighter design than Goodreads, which is a good start. It has the features you’d expect from an app to track your reading: several bookshelves, with the ability to add more, reviews and a rating scheme (number of stars out of five), as well as following of and by other readers. The other prominent feature of Literal is that it allows members to form clubs: there’s a Micro.blog club, for example, of which I was a member.</p><p>In the two months I was there, I posted reviews, some very short, of 12 books that I'd read during that period. As <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/death-of-the-book-review.html\">I've said before</a> (<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/book-review-still-dying.html\">more than once</a>), I'm not enthusiastic about book reviews: I wrote these ones only because the opportunity was there and I felt that I ought to take it. When I decided to delete my Literal library, I found that only 3 of the 12 were worth preserving: the other 9 just duplicated what I'd written elsewhere about the same books. So, from my point of view, the review feature was little more than a distraction.</p><p>I didn't rate any books: I've never been happy with the star-based rating scheme: three or four stars can cover a very wide range in terms of writing quality, subject matter or interest, and in the end tell another potential reader very little worth knowing. One of the reasons I had been glad to leave Goodreads was that it meant I'd never again have to rate a book out of 5.</p><p>The following/followers feature of Literal didn’t appeal to me either. Quite apart from the fact that I’ve long been convinced that <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/following.html\">following is broken</a>, I don’t tend to look to friends and acquaintances for reading recommendations. Perhaps it’s a mistake not to, but I usually have a fairly good idea of what I want to read next. I’m inclined to think that including a “social” element in an app focused on reading is a bit of a mismatch.</p><p>But the immediate reason for my decision to depart from Literal were the bookshelves. I felt that adding books to a “Want to read” shelf, then (ideally) moving them to “Reading” and ultimately to “Read” was really a waste of time and something that, at some stage, I was going to fall out of the habit of doing. The “Reading” shelf is particularly redundant — it exists only as a stepping-stone between the other two. I <em>know</em> what I’m reading at any one time — and if I’ve lost track of that, it’s probably because I don’t want to finish the book anyway. There’s no need for a reminder.</p><p>I don’t need to keep track of what I’ve finished reading. I reread a lot in any case, so if I start to reread something without <em>realizing</em> it’s a reread, it’s no big deal. I’m probably not going to consult the list before starting on a book in any case. And do I just keep adding things to the list as I finish them, and let it keep getting longer and longer? If not, surely it would be less useful as a list of things I had read recently (and had a better chance of remembering) than of books I had read long ago. But how do you go about compiling that kind of list? Have a rule that automatically deletes everything you’ve finished in the last, say, 18 months?</p><p>But the real problem is with the “Want to read” list. Every time I compile one of those, I end up with different books on it — and <em>not</em> because I’ve already read all the ones that were on the previous version. I sometimes feel that adding books to a “Want to read” list makes it <em>less</em> likely that I’ll eventually read them, because I’ve already dealt with them in <em>some</em> way, so they’re no longer pressing. I react to a “To read” list in much the same way as I do to a “To do” (tout doux) list: I resent and resist the expectation that I should follow a program or set of instructions, even though it’s a program I’ve compiled myself! In all honesty, I can’t claim to be spontaneous about many things but I’d like at least to <em>aspire</em> to being spontaneous about what I read next.</p><p>So, that’s broadly why I’ve concluded that Literal is not for me. I just hope I remember this, and the reasons I’ve given above, the next time a potential “Goodreads killer” comes along. I also hope I’ve managed to persuade myself not to spend too much time trying to figure out the intricacies of <a href=\"https://github.com/moonbuck/plugin-bookshelves\">moonbuck’s Bookshelves plugin for Micro.blog</a>, so that I can display all three of the <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2021/05/11/bookshelves-beta-for.html\">shelves that Manton Reece added to Micro.blog</a> on one page!</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>For the past two months I’ve been using Literal.club, a site and app that allow members to track the books they’re reading, to rate and review them, and add them to shelves (rather like Goodreads). At the weekend I decided that Literal isn’t for me. I tried to delete my account but nothing happened. I did manage to empty my library and I removed the app from my phone.</p><p>I’ll write a blog post in the next 2 weeks or so, explaining why I didn’t stick with Literal. In the meantime, before I cleared the library, I copied the 12 reviews I’d posted there during that 2 months. It was immediately clear that 9 of them weren’t worth keeping because I’d written about the same books at greater length, either in my newsletter or on my personal site. These, in order of the dates on which I posted the reviews, are the three that aren’t duplicated anywhere else:</p><h2>Charles Cumming, <cite>Box 88</cite></h2><p>9 Oct 2021: In 1989, a young Scotsman, just finished his A-Levels, spies on an Iranian businessman and Rafsanjani confidant while they’re both visiting his schoolfriend’s family in the south of France. In the present day, the same man, Lachlan Kite, now running a secret, rogue intelligence-and-assassination outfit, is interrogated by former Iranian agents as to what went wrong 30 years earlier. Fun and tense, with bursts of violent action.</p><h2>Louise O’Neill, <cite>After the Silence</cite></h2><p>16 Oct 2021: Overall, I found <cite>After the Silence</cite>, the first book I’ve read by Louise O’Neill, a disappointment. It’s excellent on the way that some men are able to abuse and control their wives and other women. The central character, Keelin, was physically assaulted by her first husband. Her second, Henry, takes advantage of circumstances that leave her vulnerable to manipulation, He monitors her phone calls and internet use, dictates what she eats and how she dresses and essentially controls her life, while denying that he’s doing anything of the sort. All of this is handled extremely well, though maybe it goes on a bit too long. The whodunnit element, in contrast, was resolved with gloomy predictability in what had seemed from early on to be the only way it could be.</p><p>I usually don’t think a reader is justified in complaining that an author has written a different book from the one the reader wanted but in this case I’m going to do exactly that! I think this story would have been more satisfactory if the present plot had been compressed to half its length and the final third of the book had told us what Keelin did after Alex and Sinéad had left the island when, arguably, she had less reason to remain under Henry’s control.</p><h2>Michael Connelly, <cite>The Law of Innocence</cite></h2><p>6 Nov 2021: I love novels that feature criminal trials, and this is the fifth (out of six) that I’ve read in Michael Connelly’s Lincoln Lawyer series. The one I skipped is the previous book in the series, The Gods of Guilt. I thought I’d finished with Connelly and his tarnished hero, Mickey Haller. But this one had an irresistible premise: Haller is accused of (eventually first-degree) murder and is leading his own defence from his jail cell. Like most legal thrillers, this is an intoxicating mixture of plausibility and wild fantasy: the stakes are high — Haller faces life without parole — and the course of the trial is unpredictable, but the action moves at a pace, and a level of drama, that would’t — couldn’t — be tolerated in a real criminal trial.

			"content_html": "<p>I’m very pleased with the way the newsletter’s first year has gone, and I’ve been asking myseslf whether there are ways I might make it even better. Almost from the start, I’ve thought that I’d like to be able to send out a material object as well as an electronic one. At the moment, you can read the newsletter in an email client, an RSS reader or on the web archive, but not on paper, unless you print it from one of those three sources.</p><p>I find myself returning to the idea that, in addition to these, there should also be a more tangible, durable option. In part, this is a response to Paul Graham’s advice to “<a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">do things that won’t scale</a>”. Not that scale is a particular problem at the moment: I could send personally signed, handwritten postcards to everybody who is currently signed up for the newsletter (if I had their/your postal addresses, which of course I don’t) without overstretching my capacity.</p><p>But it isn’t <em>just</em> a question of doing something that doesn’t scale. A newsletter issue that exists only in the form of bytes and data inevitably seems more ephemeral, more easily overlooked or forgotten than one that has a substantial existence. It’s also fixed and no longer editable, so there’s a greater incentive to make sure that I get it right first time. It would be a bigger commitment.</p><p>In short, I’m thinking about offering subscribers the option of receiving each issue of the newsletter in print. Obviously, that would have to be a paid option: I’d need to cover the cost of postage, paper and printing, as well as the additional time required for layout and editing. It’s quite likely that I wouldn’t find any takers who were willing to pay to receive a printed issue of the newsletter by [snail]mail. That’s fine: I don’t mind if there are no takers but I think it’s important that the option should be available. If <em>nobody</em> wants to pay for it, I won’t have to buy envelopes or stamps, or go to the Post Office. If only a handful of subscribers do, my costs in terms of time and materials will be proportionately small.</p><p>In order to print copies of the newsletter, I’ll need to create PDF versions from which to do so. This opens up the possibility of offering an intermediate tier in which readers paying a smaller subscription could get a copy of the PDF with their email, or with a download link in the RSS feed. Substack recently <a href=\"https://on.substack.com/p/new-tools-paywall-embeds\">introduced two new features</a> which strike me as perfectly suited for this. First, they made it possible to embed various kinds of documents and files (including PDF) in the newsletter emails. Second, they now allow us to make a newsletter free up to a certain point, while reserving the rest for paid subscribers.</p><p>So, what I thought of doing was to keep the body of each issue free, and include an embedded PDF in a paid-only section at the end. In other words, everybody would be able to read the content of every issue, by email, RSS and on the web; subscribers at the lower rate would get the PDF in addition and those (if any) at the top rate would get a printed copy sent to them in the post.</p><p>I’m thinking about charging between $10 and $12 a month for the printed version and much less than that for the embedded PDF. I think that the lowest monthly subscription that Substack allows is $5 and the lowest annual amount is $30. It seems to me that $30 a year is quite reasonable, so that’s the level at which I’d set the PDF tier. On the other hand $5 a month comes to twice that sum annually, which is steep by comparison. I saw somewhere a suggestion that it might be possible to offer a discount that would reduce the monthly subscription below $5, so I’ll look into that possibility.</p><p>If I’m going to do this, I’ll most likely start in January. It’s not possible to comment on this site (and I don’t intend to change that) but I am very interested to hear what you think. To make your views heard, either comment on <a href=\"https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/p/pdf-and-print-editions/comments\">this thread</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/artkavana\">tweet at me</a>. I look forward to the discussion.</p>",

			"title": "Its hour come round at last: Brian Moore, Catholics",
			"content_html": "<p>This is the second work of fiction I’ve read recently that was set in the near future when it was written, but where the imagined future period has now become part of our past. Last week, I wrote about Philip Kerr’s <cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite>, written in 1992 about a futuristic 2013. Today, I’m concerned with Brian Moore’s 1972 novella, <cite>Catholics</cite>, published some seven years after the Second Vatican Council ended, but set in the aftermath of the (fictional) Fourth.</p><p>The exact date of the setting isn’t identified but it’s shortly before the end of the twentieth century. When James Kinsella lands on the island of Muck in a helicopter, the abbot of the island’s monastery tells him:</p><blockquote>“… that’s the first flying machine of any description that has ever landed on Muck. You’ve brought us the symbol of the century. Just when I thought we’d be able to close the hundred years out and say we’d missed our time.”</blockquote><p>Later, not long before Kinsella leaves the island, he responds to the abbot:</p><blockquote>“This is the end of the twentieth century, not the beginning of the thirteenth. How can we even define what heresy is today?”</blockquote><p>So, we seem to be in or around 1999. The novella dramatizes a conflict between personal faith and institutional loyalty, between conscience and the duty to obey. This kind of conflict has existed as long as people have had consciences and institutions. Moore’s exploration of the conflict isn’t particularly dramatic but it holds some surprises.</p><p>Some of the monks of Muck Abbey, on an inaccessible, storm-tossed island off the south-west coast of Ireland, have been crossing to the mainland every Sunday to say Mass in the traditional manner: in Latin, with the celebrant and congregation facing the same direction, and preceded by private, individual confession. The unapproved form of Mass becomes very popular, drawing large attendances from all over the world.</p><p>This causes embarrassment to the Vatican, which is engaged in ecumenical negotiations with Buddhism, so the father general of their order sends a troubleshooter whose task is to leave the abbot in no doubt that any continuation of these heterodox practices will not be tolerated. That the institution will win is all but inevitable. The abbot has the same rank as a bishop and can’t simply be told what to do by his provincial, but the father general has the right to transfer him to a very different office, and can put pressure on him by threatening to do so.</p><p>It’s usual in conflicts of this sort for author and reader alike to sympathize with the rebel cause. And these rebels are personally sympathetic. Father Manus is patently sincere and well intentioned when he defends the traditional Mass in Latin, leading the abbot to respond, “I wish I had all that fire and conviction, Manus”. Father Matthew, the “Master of novices with no novices to master”, is more confrontational but no less sincere in his convictions. Like Manus, he insists that the Mass and the consecration are a mystery and “a miracle”.</p><p>Kinsella, an American whose ancestors came from County Mayo, is the priest sent by the father general to sort out the problem. Before he leaves, he tells the father general that he visited Ireland once before, for the Yeats Summer School in Sligo. The father general quotes the penultimate line of “The Second Coming”:</p><blockquote>“‘What rough beast, its hour come round at last.’ Appropriate. I want you to bury this beast. And I think the way to do that is for me to give you plenipotentiary status. Emissaries who must report back to headquarters, especially young ones, would seem to these old mastodons to be mere novices …”</blockquote><p>As Kinsella goes to meet the abbot for the first time, there is an echo of the poem’s opening phrase:</p><blockquote>Kinsella, turning and turning in that cold stone turret to come out through the narrow door into the abbot’s parlor, was dizzying, confusing,  causing him, at first, to miss his host’s welcoming hand.</blockquote><p>Perhaps the second-best-known lines of the poem come at the end of the first verse paragraph:</p><blockquote>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>Are full of passionate intensity.</blockquote><p>These lines aren’t quoted in the novella but there’s little room for doubt that Moore had them in mind. There’s been some disagreement as to whether Yeats was attempting to describe a universal truth or merely commenting on the circumstances of that historical moment. <cite>The Irish Times</cite>’s <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/in-a-word-intensity-1.2371595\">Patsy McGarry favours the second alternative</a>. The quote, he says:</p><blockquote>… has been used again and again over the past century, or thereabouts, to give intensity a bad name. It’s as if some believe Yeats was promulgating a profound insight into the human condition, whereas he was just making an observation from a particular place and time.</blockquote><p>The particular place and time were the aftermath of the first world war in Europe, so he has a point. I’d find McGarry’s argument more convincing, though, if it didn’t focus solely on intensity but paid more attention to passion. It’s not intensity in itself that’s characteristic of “the worst”, but <em>passionate</em> intensity, that is to say an intensity that has a person in its grip and can’t be controlled.</p><p>The character in Moore’s novella who most obviously lacks all conviction is the abbot. He twice utters the phrase, “I am not a holy man”. The second time, he goes on to explain:</p><blockquote>“I am a sort of foreman here, a sort of manager. It’s not a lot different from a secular job. The monks work hard and my job is to keep them together and see that they make a go of it. It’s a simple life here. Little jokes, little triumphs, little disasters. We’re like a bunch of children, we pass the days as if we had an endless supply of them. It’s only when someone like yourself comes along that we ask ourselves what we are here for.”</blockquote><p>The abbot has long since given up praying. There had been times, culminating in a visit to Lourdes, when attempting to pray had brought on him a sense that he was entering a void, “the hell of no feeling”, which made him tremble unbearably. The prayers seemed false and without meaning. In Lourdes, he had protected himself from these feelings by shutting himself in his room for two days, claiming to have dysentery.</p><blockquote>So the abbot avoided prayer. One could pretend to a preference for private devotions. One’s Mass could be said alone. He no longer read his daily office. As for public prayers, in a community like this there were always others, greedy to lead. Sometimes, one had to say a grace. One said the words, but did not pray. If one did not risk invoking God, one did not risk one’s peace of mind. He was needed here. He did his work. He did his best. But did not pray.</blockquote><p>If the abbot is unwilling to end the Latin Mass and the private confessions, it is not on the grounds of belief or doctrine but rather because he feels a sense of responsibility for the wellbeing of the monks, like Manus and Matthew, for whom faith in the miracles of consecration and transubstantiation is the essence of their religion.</p><p>The abbot decides that his duty of obedience to the order and its father general must outweigh that responsibility to his subordinates. He writes a letter to the father general and assures Kinsella that he will give the order that in future Mass must be celebrated and confession heard in accordance with the approved rites. But he wants Kinsella to leave the island before he announces his decision to the monks:</p><blockquote>“You see, that will be the important part, how I break it to them. Some of them are very devout. They will take it hard. No, it will not be easy at all. To tell you the truth I am a bit nervous about it.”</blockquote><p>On first reading of the novella, I suspected that the abbot was playing some devious game. He would profess obedience to his superior and loudly proclaim the end of the outdated, traditional practices, while tacitly encouraging dissent and revolt among the monks. Surely, that was the point of his exchange with Father Matthew the night before Kinsella’s departure:</p><blockquote>“I am informed by Rome that the Mass is now merely symbolic. Do you understand what I am saying?”</blockquote><blockquote>“That is heresy, pure and simple!”</blockquote><p>And shortly afterwards:</p><blockquote>“Our visitor brings an order from our father general. Would you obey that order, Father Matthew, even if that order instructed you to consider the Mass not as a miracle, but, let’s say, just a pious ritual?”</blockquote><p>Kinsella believes that the Mass is no more than a pious ritual that doesn’t entail the real presence of God, and he assures the abbot that this is the belief of most modern Catholics. But it’s a misrepresentation  on the abbot’s part to suggest that the father general’s order requires the celebrant of the Mass to believe likewise. The order concerns the form of the ritual, not the priest’s state of mind. It doesn’t attempt to compel belief, or disbelief.</p><p>In other words, the abbot is presenting the situation to Father Matthew in the way that it least likely to be acceptable to him. Is he doing so to stir up dissent or merely to test the other man’s obedience? After Matthew has gone to bed, as he has been ordered to do, the abbot regrets his own “unruly temper”.</p><p>Once Kinsella has left in the helicopter, the abbot makes his decision known to the monks. As he expected, they take it hard.</p><blockquote>… he saw in those faces that he was failing, that he was losing them, that he must do something he had never done, give something he had never given in these, his years as their abbot. What had kept him in fear since Lourdes, must now be faced. What he feared most to do must be done. And if, in doing it, I enter null and never return, amen. My time has come.</blockquote><p>Telling them that “Prayer is the only miracle” and “If our words become prayer, God will come”, he kneels to lead them in the “Our Father”.</p><blockquote>His trembling increased. He entered null. He would never come back.</blockquote><p>So, the abbot was sincere in his professions of obedience after all. The ending of the novel is clearly based on a paradox: it is the man without faith who, to bring about a more secular Church where the traditional beliefs are no more than optional, who must sacrifice himself to “a sort of purgatory presaging the true hell to come”.</p><p>I don’t find the paradox wholly convincing; but arguably it’s in the nature of paradox to tend to undermine itself. Moore’s novella was certainly a more interesting and rewarding read than I feared it might be.</p>",

			"title": "Philip Kerr, A Philosophical Investigation (1992)",
			"content_html": "<img src=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/kerr-philosoph-investig.png\" alt=\"Cover image: A Philosophical Investigation, paperback\" width=\"640\" height=\"1024\" /><p>A few weeks ago, I reread Philip Kerr’s <cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite>, which I previously read in the summer of 1993. I remembered absolutely nothing about the novel except that it featured a serial killer named Wittgenstein. Even that solitary recollection was misleading: “Wittgenstein” was merely a secret codename, and the character was labelled a “multiple murderer”, or simply a “multiple”, not a serial killer. I might as well have been reading the novel for the first time.</p><p>In 1993 I hadn’t yet read Eliot’s “The Waste Land”, so I presumably overlooked the novel’s allusions to that poem, though I must have noticed those to “The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock”. Now that I recognize “The Waste Land” references I don’t know what to make of them. Some of them seem purely superficial: for example, one victim of a killer whose codename is Shakespeare is named Mary Woolnoth, another Jessie Weston. (Jessie L Weston wrote <cite>From Ritual to Romance</cite>, to which Eliot refers in the notes to “The Waste Land”.)</p><p>I suppose that the allusions are meant to suggest that the novel is set in a land that is sick and decaying because of the shortcomings of its ruler(s); I can’t see any more specific parallels. Eliot had such a different worldview from mine — he was a Christian who thought that human consciousness had changed after Donne, and that the early seventeenth century poet had “felt his thought as immediately as the odour of a rose” — that I long ago gave up any expectation of being able fully to appreciate his poetry.</p><p>At least Eliot’s poetry is familiar (though certainly not easy) territory to me; I’m quite incapable of saying what light is thrown on the novel by the philosophy of Wittgenstein. For one thing, I’ve never had the kind of mind that easily (or at all) gets to grips with philosophy. Even with Marx (whose <cite>Theses on Feuerbach</cite> would have provided the title to this note if I hadn’t decided on Empson’s “This Last Pain” instead) I’ve always found the economics easier to grasp and more compelling than the philosophy.</p><p>So, I read the novel feeling all the time that a substantial part of its significance was going right over my head. Unexpectedly, that was not at all an unpleasant feeling, though I don’t usually enjoy having my attention drawn to the gaps in my understanding. This note is evidence of my unwillingness to pass over in silence that of which I personally cannot speak (though others presumably could). Those others have been frustratingly reticent: though the novel is almost 30 years old, I haven’t been able to find any substantial discussion online of its “ideas”.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Isadora Jacowicz is in charge of a unit that investigates the murders of women, a crime of which there’s an epidemic in the London of 2013. (The novel is set 21 years in the future from when it was published in 1992. It’s been an eventful 21 years.) Jake, a specialist in gynocide, is put in charge of an investigation into the multiple murders of men — a much rarer crime.</p><p>It turns out that killer and victims alike have all been identified by the Lambroso project, in effect because of the shape of their brains, as having a particular propensity to violence. Men so identified are offered therapy and medication to control their violent tendencies, and their names are placed on a confidential database which flags them up if they should be involved in a violent crime, but not otherwise.</p><p>To the killer, codenamed Wittgenstein, it seems obvious that his murderous inclinations can best be put to use in eliminating the other men in the programme who share his own propensities. At least one of his targets, “Shakespeare”, really is a multiple murderer. Shakespeare notices that he is being followed and confronts Wittgenstein, frightening him off. Ironically, Shakespeare is later killed by Jake, who has shot low, aiming for his legs, and accidentally hit his femoral artery.</p><p>Against Jake’s protests, and under pressure from the Home Office, a Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge (best known for his detective novels featuring the investigations of Plato) tries to persuade Wittgenstein that the logic of his position should lead him to take his own life. This doesn’t immediately carry any weight with the killer, who can see that it’s an attempt to manipulate him; but he eventually comes to see the force of the argument. Jake doesn’t want Wittgenstein to kill himself; she’d prefer to arrest him and see him go on trial. On conviction (which is almost inevitable, given the evidence) the killer will be sentenced to indefinite Punitive Coma.</p><p>Jake does not herself approve of Punitive Coma:</p><blockquote>As punishments went it was worse than a long term of imprisonment and almost worse than death itself. But this is what happened when society had become morally squeamish about capital punishment and when prisons had become too overcrowded and expensive to be practical for any but minor offenders. (<cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite>, Quercus Editions paperback, 2020, p. 302)</blockquote><p>Punitive Coma is not necessarily final, at least in theory. A Home Office minister tells journalists:</p><blockquote>And the best argument of all for PC as the law’s ultimate sanction is that, where mistakes are made — and let’s face it, any system is fallible — a sentence can be reversed. (p. 495)</blockquote><p>Of course, someone in a coma is no more likely than someone in a grave to be preparing an appeal or a petition for clemency, or instructing lawyers, so the “best argument” for Punitive Coma is moot. Anybody facing the procedure will know that it’s overwhelmingly unlikely that he or she will ever emerge from it, and that there’s no guarantee that he or she won’t feel anything while in that state, waiting for the end.</p><p>Jake examines one of the drawers, “slightly larger than a coffin”, in which comatose convicts were to be stored:</p><blockquote>The bottom of the drawer was upholstered in soft black calf leather, which was the only concession made to the prevention of pressure sores. A number of tubes and catheters, which would be attached to the convict’s body, protruded from the drawer’s sides. (p. 489)</blockquote><p>Jake’s determination to prevent Wittgenstein’s suicide and instead to play her part in delivering him to this fate might therefore look more like vindictiveness than a simple wish to do her duty. In fact, the book is rather more ambiguous about Jake’s intentions and motivations than this suggests. There’s an implication that her accidental killing of Shakespeare might have satified her previously thwarted desire to kill her brutal father. There are other indications that what Jake feels towards Wittgenstein at the end is closer to sympathy than a thirst for retribution.</p><p>When he talks about the restoration “of moral order to a world that was temporarily upset by my crimes”, she answers:</p><blockquote>”Any restoration such as you describe would be an illusion, in my opinion,” she said … If I have any explanation at all, it’s that you can no longer distinguish between what is real and what is unreal. But that doesn’t make you so very different from a lot of other people. Nobody cares much for reality any more … Is that what you would call a moral order? If you ask me, there’s not much balance around anywhere. And this — this investigation was just a holding action.” (pp. 503–04, ellipses added)</blockquote><p>Is that what makes this story a <em>philosophical</em> investigation, in contrast with the traditional fictional investigation whose function is to restore order to the world? That explanation is good enough for me.</p>",
