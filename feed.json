			"content_html": "<p>In or about 1991, the playwright David Hare caused a commotion on BBC2’s arts show with his assertion that too many critics and cultural commentators knew how to sneer but didn’t know how to judge. They could appear “critical” by finding some weakness or infelicity in any given book, play, film, dance performance or piece of music, but they either weren’t equipped or simply weren’t willing to arrive at an assessment of the worth of the work in question: whether it was significant; whether its effects on society, a community or the spectators’s spirits were good or bad; how it should be evaluated. In the end, the prolific sneering was not supported by any system of values. According to Hare, if you wanted to be a serious critic, you had to be willing to say that Keats was better than Bob Dylan.</p><p>This provoked a response, of course, but it was a response that missed Hare’s point. “<em>Is</em> Keats better than Dylan?” the critics asked, some with a sneer, others presumably suppressing one. But I don’t remember hearing any of them address the more general question of <em>judgment</em>, which had been the one animating the playwright. The Dylan/Keats juxtaposition was merely an illustrative example, but that was what the responders latched onto. In taking such care to avoid Hare’s main point, the critics seemed to be making it for him.</p><p>I was firmly on Hare’s side, and excited to hear him articulate so clearly what had been my own uncrystallized opinion. At the time I was still very left-wing, and Hare had a reputation as a theatrical revolutionary. I hadn’t really liked what I’d seen (or, before my arrival in London three years earlier, read) of his plays. But his views on criticism were reassuringly close to my own.</p><p>Of course, the obvious thing about judgment is that it can’t be arbitrary. You have to judge according to a standard or a yardstick: a set of conditions or values. For me, with my political views at that time, the selection of an appropriate yardstick was straightforward: any work was to be judged by the extent to which it either shored up or undermined the capitalist basis of the society in which it was produced. Was its effect, objectively viewed, progressive; or was it reactionary or conservative?</p><p>The fervour of my socialist convictions lasted barely another two years following the Hare broadcast. I’ve written before that when you change a fundamental belief your other opinions, including those founded on nothing more solid than the one you’ve just abandoned, don’t automatically get replaced by something more consonant with your revised philosophy. My insistence on the importance of critical judgment survived the change in my politics. In fact, the connection between the two has been invisible to me: it’s only now, in starting to write this post, that I see where the commitment to judgment originally came from.</p><p>Also around 2 years after Hare’s appearance on <cite>The Late Show</cite>, I went back to university and, in my 30s, began to study for a BA in English literature. One of the first-year courses was an introduction to literary theory given by Len Jackson (author of the three books in Longman’s series “Foundations of modern literary theory”). In an early lecture, Len said that there are essentially three ways of writing about literature: theory, criticism and scholarship. Of the three, I was immediately sure that the one that appealed to me was criticism.</p><p>Theory at the time was dominated by disciples of Foucault, Derrida and similar paradoxical thinkers. I’d already read enough of this to know it wasn’t a path I wanted to follow. I retained enough of my former Marxism to recognize a type of discourse that sounded “radical”, while at the same time purporting to demonstrate the futility of trying to alter actual social relations. It seemed designed (though I’m sure most of its proponents weren’t conscious of its objective effects) to provide students (and still more so their lecturers) with an outlet for their rebellious aspirations without posing a threat to anything of consequence. The only venerable institutions at risk were reading-lists full of dead, white, European males.</p><p>Scholarship, in contrast to theory, was admirable, easily undervalued and utterly essential to the whole process of writing about literature. I thought of it as a kind of self-sacrifice, whose practitioners set about reading the boring stuff: contemporary newspapers and pamphlets, public records, personal correspondence and other unexciting material. They held back from reading “the works themselves”, in order to make it easier for <em>other</em> people to enjoy them without making egregious historical and contextual errors. Scholarship was the foundation without which the elaborate theoretical and critical structures would collapse.</p><p>As for me, there was no doubt in my mind that what I wanted to do was focus on “the works themselves”. It now seems to me that I must have made a tacit deal with myself according to which, to justify such self-indulgence, I should have to perform important work of judgment and evaluation.</p><p>So, I’ve believed for at least 30 years that the paramount responsibility of the literary critic is judgment. That’s not as straightforward or simple a belief as it sounds. As I said before, to judge you need a yardstick or set of standards, and I had quickly discarded those I started out with. I wasn’t finding it easy to replace them. The problem is that you can’t use a yardstick or standards that are too fixed or inflexible, otherwise you risk approaching each work with your mind already made up. I concluded that this trap could be avoided only by treating each work as containing — indeed as constituting — its own key. You learn how to interpret (and judge) each book (or poem, play etc) by reading that book, poem or play itself (or by seeing the play in performance). To put it another way, in reading a book, ideally you will be reevaluating what you’ve already read and are continuing to read, in the light of what you’re reading, as you’re reading it. That’s one of the reasons I think rereading is so important.</p><p>To be clear, none of this is to claim that I’ve been consistently exercising critical judgment towards everything I’ve read in various genres, styles and forms, over the years since I enrolled for the BA. But I was convinced that, ideally, that’s what I <em>ought to have been</em> doing. Whenever I wrote a book review, or a blog post about a book, or an essay for an academic journal, this sense that I really should be assessing the work by exercising objective, rational judgment, was always present as a kind of lodestone, trying to draw my writing in a particular direction.</p><p>Until the week before last. Then, <cite>The Observer</cite>’s long-standing information technology columnist, John Naughton, posted on his blog <a href=\"https://memex.naughtons.org/saturday-14-november-2020/32002/\">a quote from Robert Musil</a>:</p><blockquote>Only in the most unusual cases is it useful to determine whether a book is good or bad. It is usually both.</blockquote><p>This is from Musil’s <cite>Precision and Soul: Essays and addresses</cite>. It was unfamiliar to me. It states an obvious, uncomplicated truth, one that I find it hard to believe I’ve overlooked for so many years. Most of us, most of the time, don’t read a book in order to judge it. We read it perhaps to learn something, to find a piece of information, to prepare an argument, speech or essay. We may read it for entertainment, to pass the time or to exercise some faculty of our brain. Ultimately, a lot of reading is done primarily for pleasure of one sort or another. Sometimes, but certainly not always, judgment is desirable or unavoidable.</p><p>Sometimes, on the other hand, judgment is just too easy: a way to preempt ostensibly less important but more interesting questions. Many years ago, I came across a truly atrocious paragraph in Timothy Mo’s <cite>The Redundancy of Courage</cite>. I no longer remember any detail about it except that it was the last paragraph on a recto some way into the book. I finished that book but felt absolved from ever again having to read anything by Timothy Mo, and I’ve taken full advantage of that dispensation.</p><p>Something similar happened around the same time, when I was reading <cite>The Book of Evidence</cite> by John Banville. The novel centres on a violent murderer, who is eventually arrested and brought before the District Court. His senior counsel (SC) makes an application for bail, which is immediately refused. It couldn’t have been granted. Only the High Court has (and then had) jurisdiction to allow bail on a murder charge, something an SC appearing in those circumstances would certainly know. (Senior counsel were rare in the District Court, tending to appear only in cases of murder or drunken driving.)</p><p>Reading that passage, I no longer felt I was in the hands of an author I could trust. In this case, too, I finished the book but I haven’t read anything else by John Banville, whether published before or after <cite>The Book of Evidence</cite>. I suspect that the losses have been mine rather than Banville’s or Mo’s. Till now, I’ve been happy to live with that.</p><p>Prompted by that brief quote from Robert Musil, I’ve decided to change my critical (and reading) practice. From now on, I’m going to try to read books (and plays, and poetry, and web pages, and whatever else) for whatever they might have to offer, and not with a constant eye to what I think is the value of the work. “Whatever they might have to offer” covers a wide variety of possibilities, not all equally worthwhile, and I’ll try not to be narrow in my expectations. I’m not sure what that will mean in practice: I want to be more open to what I read; and it’s not possible to be “open” while laying down in advance too rigid a set of criteria. My change of attitude might not make any appreciable difference, either to what I take from my reading or to how I write about it. It will be interesting to find out.</p><p>I’ve never read anything by Robert Musil. As a teenager, I was attracted by the cover art and the description on the back of the Picador edition of <cite>The Man without Qualities</cite>, but put off by the book’s length and the fact that he had never finished it. Decades later, I still haven’t read it. Maybe I should.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>When I decided consciously to continue the boycott of Amazon that I had drifted into without noticing, part of my reason was anger at what the online retailer was doing to booksellers, independent and conglomerate alike. Amazon is one of the main factors driving bookshops out of business. Is the drawn-out but apparently inevitable disappearance of those booksellers regrettable? I’ll admit that, in answering that question to my own satisfaction, I may not have been entirely consistent.</p><p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve resisted the idea that it’s an ethical duty to favour small, independent, local businesses, such as corner shops, family-run operations or the self-employed entrepreneur, over large corporations, chains, multinational enterprises and retail giants. If we have no choice but to live in a capitalist economy, then why shouldn’t we take the benefits of capitalism — economies of scale, minuscule profit margins, price competition, customer service — along with the uglier essential features of the system: exploitation, low wages, long working hours and unfulfillable lives?</p><p>One might be personally sympathetic to the small business-owner, the corner grocer or the individual craft-worker, but sympathy can’t change the fact that the current of capitalist economic development is against them, and will remain so as long as we retain an economic system grounded on private ownership of capital. We might expect things to be different after the revolution — but the revolution still seems a long way off. In the meantime, why favour a shop assistant in the next street over a factory worker on a different continent? Can mere proximity make one more deserving of the insignificant effect of my purchasing power than the other?</p><p>Buying books is an actvity of a different kind from stocking up on groceries or household items. Or at least it was until Amazon came along. The main reason why I’d tend to buy my everyday essentials in a chain supermarket in preference to Henry’s Corner Shop is that I could expect them to be noticeably cheaper in the former. But there was never much price variation between <a href=\"http://www.stokenewingtonbookshop.co.uk\">the Stoke Newington Bookshop</a> on the one hand and Waterstones or <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/closing-down-sale-begins-books-etc\">Books etc</a> on the other. If I went to the bigger outlet first, it wasn’t because I was hoping for a bargain, but because there was a better chance their more extensive stock would include the book I was looking for. On the less frequent occasions I went to Stoke Newington, it was primarily to browse, not intending to buy a specific book.</p><p>Competition held the independents’ prices at a level comparable to the larger sellers, so price wasn’t a reason to prefer the latter to the former. Amazon changed that. It had the resources to discount books more deeply than either the chains or the independents were willing or able to go. And I, among millions of others, took the bait. I began to buy most of my books from Amazon (who not only offered the lowest price but could supply any title quicker than it could be ordered through even the largest chain stores) particularly after I moved to France in 2005/6. It was much cheaper to order English language books from Amazon.co.uk than from any French site, including Amazon.fr so that’s exactly what I did.</p><p>Around the same time as I moved, the economist Tyler Cowen wrote an essay, “What are independent bookstores really good for?” for <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2006/05/the-death-of-the-independent-bookstore.html\">Slate</a>, in which he argued that independent bookstores were not fulfilling a particularly useful function and that their decline in the face of competition from the likes of Barnes \u0026 Noble and Borders was not something to be particularly lamented. Typically, the independents don’t provide any greater literary or specialist expertise than a chain store, their main advantage for the reader or browser is that they may confer the appearance of hipness, of being “more literary or more offbeat” than the norm, and they will usually carry a more limited stock than the larger bookseller. </p><blockquote>But when it comes to providing simple access to the products you want, the superstores often do a better job of it than the small stores do: Borders and Barnes \u0026 Noble negotiate bigger discounts from publishers and have superior computer-driven inventory systems. The superstores’ scale allows them to carry many more titles, usually several times more, than do most of the independents; so if you’re looking for Arabic poetry you have a better chance of finding it at Barnes \u0026 Noble than at your local community bookstore.</blockquote><p>So, if Cowen was right, maybe I should be no more concerned about the threat to the survival of the independent bookseller than about the economic troubles of the newsagent down the street? At the time, I would have believed that. If I had read Cowen’s short essay when it first appeared or in the next few years, I’d quite likely have nodded my head in firm agreement. I hadn’t yet realized just how destructive a force Amazon had become.</p><p>Barely 5 years after Cowen’s piece was published, Borders had closed forever. Barnes \u0026 Noble seems to have <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2019/06/06/rumor-barnes-noble-to-be-acquired-by-the-hedge-fund-that-owns-waterstones/\">struggled for several years before it was acquired by Elliott Management</a> in 2019 and brought under the control of Waterstone’s CEO. I’ve seen some speculation (such as <a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/independent-bookstores-doing-better-than-ever-in-2012/\">this post from Melville House in 2013</a>) that independent booksellers have been better able to withstand the Amazon onslaught than the big chains. Of course, it may just be that the tribulations of the independents are less visible. It’s easy for the collapse or protracted insolvency of a small outlet to pass unnoticed. In any case, that was before the pandemic hit. The <cite>New York Times</cite> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/books/independent-bookstores-economy.html\">reports</a>:</p><blockquote>According to the American Booksellers Association … more than one independent bookstore has closed each week since the pandemic began. Many of those still standing are staring down the crucial holiday season and seeing a toxic mix of higher expenses, lower sales and enormous uncertainty.</blockquote><p><cite>Vox</cite>, too, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/10/25/21517545/bookstores-pandemic-booksellers-closing\">cites the ABA</a>, who say that 20% of independent bookstores across the United States are “in danger of closing”.</p><p>If huge operations like Borders and Barnes \u0026 Noble are vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the book economy, including Amazon’s predatory practices, then we need to decide whether we’re prepared to live in a world where the only substantial supplier of books is a monopolistic universal retailer who finds it more appealing to “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/books/independent-bookstores-economy.html\">colonize the moon</a>” than to cater to readers. If we aren’t happy to live in that world, independent booksellers now appear to be the only kind of enterprise capable of providing an alternative. We need to keep them in business.</p><p>Tyler Cowen may have had a good argument against indie bookstores in 2006, but the world, and the market for books, are unrecognizable now, compared with what he could have foreseen then. No doubt I’ll still buy books from Waterstones and Hodges Figgis; maybe even Easons, if I’m in a branch and they have a book I’ve been looking for. But I’ll also be making more of an effort to support my local bookshops. It’s a question of survival and not just for them but for an essential part of our culture.</p>",

			"title": "Anxiety after all",
			"content_html": "<p>I <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/unspecific-nostalgia.html\">recently suggested</a> that my habitual “unspecific nostalgia” results from feelings that were originally attached to (or stimulated by) memories that, because of SDAM, I no longer experience vividly. The nostalgic feelings are still there but they become generalized because their particular occasions no longer hold any particular significance for me.</p><p>It’s just occurred to me that something similar is probably happening with my feelings of anxiety. I’ve <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/a2b0b3bc8425\">written before</a> about the fact that it was only in my late 50s, after some sessions with a psychotherapist, that I at last recognized that I have been affected by anxiety all my life. The unexpected and unfamiliar sense of <em>wrongness</em> that I experienced during the year after I came back to Ireland at the end of 2011 was, I now think, in large part unacknowledged anxiety.</p><p>Because of a variety of factors — my age, the post-crash economy, the idiosyncratic nature of such work skills as I had managed to develop, and the fact that I had often in the past found job-search difficult — I believed it was unlikely that I’d be able to get a job and that I was probably about to fall into poverty and maybe homelessness. The prospect terrified me, but I wasn’t able to recognize that this was the case. I remained puzzled while I considered various other possibilities. I suffered wild mood swings.</p><p>When, at least five years later, the therapist pointed out to me that my main problem seemed to be anxiety, I briefly believed that I had found the reason for my inexplicable reaction to being “home” in Ireland after 24 years. A few months after my last session with the therapist, I realized that I have aphantasia, and that seemed to provide more context (and a possible explanation) for my difficulties in handling anxiety. In effect, I thought that <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/511989fa1e71\">my inability to visualize reassuring scenarios and successful outcomes was making it more difficult for me to get past the anxiety</a>. Some friends and family members that I outlined this hypothesis to thought it was unconvincing, to put it mildly.</p><p>But already I was starting to play down the anxiety and play up the aphantasia. In the same post linked to in the previous paragraph, “Aphantasia is not a disability”, I wrote:</p><blockquote>I began to wonder if anxiety isn’t my core problem after all, but just a consequence of my general inability to picture possible futures.</blockquote><p>Soon, I was considering all sorts of aphantasia-related alternatives to anxiety as explanations for my life-problems: an <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/e969c8f9587\">inability to plan, schedule or prioritize</a> because I lack a visual imagination; <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/e81dc7e0e259\">ADHD</a> and/or a difficulty with <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/c7a5cb05162c\">executive function</a> (nonverbal working memory); absence of <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/5f8642ea7c34\">motivation</a> caused by not being able to imagine <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html\">a future worth aiming for</a>; and so on. Any explanation, in short, that would minimize the significance of anxiety.</p><p>It was easy to believe that the problem was something other than anxiety because very often the task at which I was digging in my heels seemed safe and innocuous: there was no objective reason why it should make me uneasy. I’d sit down at the computer to edit a document. It would be a document of a kind I had edited hundreds of times before, with no unusual features and nothing to suggest that it would cause me any unexpected difficulty. Yet, I’d have that horrible sharp, churning feeling in the pit of my stomach, and a sense that I would have to push past an immoveable physical barrier before I could even open the document and start to read it. Or I’d procrastinate for ages before making a perfectly routine, unconfrontational phone call. How could the thing that was stopping me be anxiety, when there was clearly nothing to be anxious about?</p><p>It was only after I wrote about unspecific nostalgia that it occurred to me that I might equally be experiencing <em>unspecific anxiety</em>. In other words, the feelings of anxiety had been caused by particular experiences and episodes that had actually happened to me but that I could no longer remember except in general, almost abstract, terms. The feelings were still real but I couldn’t associate them with particular (episodic) memories. If this is true, it makes sense that I should be more susceptible to these feelings while I’m in Ireland.</p><p>When I lived in Ireland in the 1980s, there was plenty for me to be anxious about, much of it economic. I don’t want to go into details, partly because SDAM would make it difficult for me to remember them and partly, of course, because even if I could remember them the process would be painful. But, as with the feelings of nostalgia discussed in my previous post, I now think it likely that I became anxious because of specific occurrences, situations and interactions, and that the anxious feelings have survived my memories of the events that gave rise to them. As with the unspecific nostalgia, the anxiety has become generalized, and associated with Ireland/Dublin as a whole, instead of with actual incidents, encounters and things that happened.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>For perhaps the tenth time that oppressive, sticky morning, David wished he’d worn a longer skirt. The calf-length cotton print would have been perfect, but he’d talked himself into putting it back on the rail in the shop, on the grounds that it was an unnecessary expense and didn’t fit his overall “look”. He was now sure that had been a mistake. The skirt was long enough for him to have got away without wearing tights, especially with the new boots, and would have been cool enough to allow him some relief from this hellish heat.</p><p>And as for his “look”, he’d been vaguely aware, for longer than he’d like to admit, that it needed updating. It’s not unusual for men of a certain age to settle into a habitual pattern when it comes to things like clothes, food and everyday activities. Way back when he’d first started openly to dress fem, he’d warned himself that he’d have to be willing to shake things up a bit, to innovate; to get used to living — and dressing — outside his comfort zone. Instead, the comfort zone had expanded just enough to include his new reality, but no wider.</p><p>Though he would never have claimed to have any kind of visual flair, he was still pleased with himself about the look, which he had settled on as long ago as 1994. Of course, it had mutated in the years since. The tan leather jacket had been an inevitable early casualty. But at the start it had been an essential element in achieving that femmasc balance that he thought of as his defining innovation. To start with, he had worn the jacket open, over (if anything) a threadbare and torn t-shirt.</p><p>What hadn’t changed, what remained central to the concept, was the short denim skirt, not quite a mini but well above the knee, worn over thick, black, opaque tights. He loved that style of skirt, must have owned several dozen examples over the years: he was never without one. Neither would he be in the future, even though he was grudgingly coming to recognize that it was time to retire that outfit.</p><p>He had never bothered with a wig or makeup. They didn’t interest him, and it had not been his intention to pass as a woman, quite the contrary. He believed time spent applying makeup to be time inexcusably wasted, and it was hard to imagine himself wearing a wig except as part of a disguise — and disguise was the last thing on his mind. Until recently, he’d had a full head of hair, which he had generally worn long. He had eventually developed the habit of applying nail polish to his fingernails as well as to his toes.</p><p>After he’d got rid of the leather jacket, he varied his tops, while keeping the skirt and tights constant. Often, when the temperature allowed it, he’d wear just a light t-shirt, occasionally a collar and tie and for a while an expensive tweed sports jacket which might have been made to go with a denim skirt. The principle had always been masc above the waist, fem below. Well, with a couple of exceptions. His usual boots, while they perfectly accessorized the tights and skirt, would not have seemed incongruous on a marauding football hooligan; and he sometimes liked to wear a choker that he’d inherited from his mother, set with an emerald. After several years, he finally admitted that he hated the green stone — the baleful eye of a malevolent, monocular alien — so he had it replaced with a garnet.</p><p>Of course, the brightly coloured cotton print skirt would not have been suitable for mourning, but (as he noted with some relief) he clearly wasn’t feeling bereaved. Unless she’d changed more than he could imagine, Tessa wouldn’t have approved of the way he was dressed whatever he’d worn, and she was past caring now. He hadn’t seen her for ages. Without children (who might easily have been in their 30s by now anyway) there had been no reason to keep in touch, though David had followed her career with interest and more than a little vicarious pride.</p><p>David could not say for sure how much his fem dressing had contributed to their breakup, but he had no doubt that the part it had played had been neither negligible nor decisive, though tending more towards the former. Tessa had erupted when he’d announced his intention of dressing like that full-time. She had furiously demanded an explanation, and he’d attempted to provide one. Two, in fact.</p><p>Of the two, he preferred the one that Tessa had evidently not been expecting. He had said it was obvious that there is a strong taboo against men and boys behaving (and that includes dressing) in ways that tend to undermine their masculinity or bring it into question. To breach that taboo is just about the most transgressive thing a male could do without causing harm to another person; and that had made the idea all but irresistible to him.</p><p>David and Tessa had each found his explanations less than convincing, though for different reasons. He believed that both were based on true statements of fact; and that either was, objectively speaking, an adequate explanation (and justification, if one were needed) of the way he dressed, even if neither was, subjectively, his real motivation. The truth was, he didn’t know what his subjective reason was, in spite of having repeatedly, compulsively interrogated himself on the point. The objective explanations were the only ones he had, and they at least had the advantages of being true, and theoretically sufficient.</p><p>Tessa had been inclined to insist on the subjective explanation, and had become increasingly frustrated by David’s refusal or inability to offer a personal and emotional account of what had been going on in his psyche. Some years later, after they had run into each other coming out of a play at the Peacock, and agreed to meet for coffee later in the week, she told him that she had been terrified that he had really wanted to “live as a woman” and maybe even to undergo hormone treatment or surgery. Tessa was in favour of everybody’s right to live however they wanted (provided, of course, that didn’t mean exploiting or oppressing somebody else) and to become whatever they wished to be (within the limits of what was possible). She supported the rights of transgender people — but she had balked at the prospect of finding herself married to one, unexpectedly and against her will.</p><p>David had, of course, disclaimed any desire to <em>be</em> a woman. He did not think of himself as trans. For him, the issue was one of masculinity (and, to the extent that you can’t repudiate one without embracing the other, femininity), not about being male or female. But, because he seemed unable to articulate what it was he wanted and why, Tessa had concluded he must be in denial. She had believed that, unless he were going to remain in a permanent state of indecision, he would sooner or later have to transition. She didn’t want to be still married to him when that happened. (Or, to be fair to her, in any other circumstances.)</p><p>David felt a large bead of sweat roll down the hollow of his back and get trapped by the waistband of his tights. He wanted to tug at his skirt, hold it away from his body to let some cooler air in, but he knew that Tessa would have been furious at him for drawing even more attention to the way he was dressed, as if his clothes weren’t obtrusive enough in themselves. So, he forced himself to stand pokerfaced, ignoring his discomfort largely for her sake. This would be the last thing he would ever have to do for her: he could afford to give her this much, though she was no longer able to appreciate it.</p><p>First thing tomorrow, he’d go back to the shop and see if they still had the print skirt. If not, there would be other suitable clothes, a wider range than he had allowed himself to consider up to now. He might even try on a dress. He was now materially better off than he had been during his marriage or in the years immediately following it. He could afford to have dresses made or altered, so as to fit his massless, zero-dimensional boobs. He’d never worn dresses very much, and not at all since the breakup with Tessa, because he felt he couldn’t carry it off without a stuffed bra. The funny thing was that he actually liked bras, and had enjoyed wearing one on the occasions when he’d permitted himself that indulgence. They felt excitingly unfamiliar, in a way that skirt and tights no longer did for him; the slight tightness around his chest acted as an additional reminder that he was breaking the gender taboo.</p><p>But for years he hadn’t allowed himself to act on his liking for bras, because they were anatomically unwarranted. They smacked of dressing up, which in turn suggested either childish games or attempts to pass as female. If there was one thing that David wanted even less than to pretend to be a woman, it was to treat his fem dressing as a game, a prank, or in any sense frivolous. It was none of these things, but rather an intensely serious effort to free himself from the demands of his masculine traits. A bra had no function to perform in that struggle.</p><p>Or so he had long thought. Now, with no further need to prove to Tessa that his sartorial choices were about anything other than a desire to become a woman, perhaps he could afford to relax his personal dress code just a little. He wouldn’t be throwing out his denim skirts, to be sure, but nor would he be relying on them as his unvarying uniform, like Steve Jobs’s black turtlenecks. If he started to wear dresses regularly that would necessarily mean a departure from his fundamental rule: masc above the waist, fem below.</p><p>A rethink was overdue. Though he wasn’t going to get rid of the skirts, the same was absolutely not true of his tights. Tights might be the most deceptive of garments, delivering almost exactly the opposite of what they promised. They seemed to offer a form-hugging, shape-outlining, limb-clinging barely thereness. Instead, they drooped and sagged, seemed always to be trying to return to a shape that was entirely their own (not yours), regularly required tugging back into place, and refused to let you forget that you were wearing them. Along with their sturdier cousins, leggings, they were probably his least favourite things to wear. He hated them, if anything, even more fiercely than he had hated the boxers he’d once felt obliged to wear.</p><p>The irony was that his inflexible rules of dress had for years denied him the freedom to wear a bra, while requiring him to pull on tights practically every day, and all supposedly in the name of allowing him greater control over how he presented himself to the world. He felt a dangerously compelling urge to tear off his tights then and there. He refused to put up with them a moment longer, and was ready to rip them from his legs, shredding them with long, sharp, purple nails, until all that was left were the tattered wisps of synthetic fabric sticking out of the tops of his boots. To his relief, he was able to resist the impulse: even if Tessa was now permanently out of reach of any embarrassment he might cause her, he still had a responsibility to allow her remains to depart in dignity.</p><p>David was one of the first to leave the crematorium. He hadn’t planned to go to lunch, but now he thought he’d skip the drinks as well. Most of Tessa’s friends at the end were people he didn’t know. Instead, he’d go home, have a shower and change his clothes. Later, he would toast Tessa’s memory privately, alone in a quiet bar they had both liked. As he reached the bus stop, he ran his right thumbnail down the side of his leg and deliberately, surreptitiously, made a small rip in his tights, just at the hemline of his skirt.</p>",

			"content_html": "<h2>Once, in real time, without a rehearsal</h2><p>Two weeks ago, I posted “<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/unspecific-nostalgia.html\">I think I’m finally over France</a>” in which I looked at my tendency to try to <em>relive</em> episodes and events that have already happened to me, presumably because I’m not able to <em>remember</em> them as vividly as someone who doesn’t have SDAM might do.</p><p>Among the things about the time I lived in France that I’d like to be able to recall, but certainly can’t now relive, are the childhoods of two of my nephews, one of whom is also one of my godsons. They’re now 16 and 17, and were 7 and 8 when I left France at the end of 2011. Since that experience is not relivable, I’d like to think instead about an aspect of my time in France where the relationship between memory and repetition is a bit more complex.</p><p>I’ve never been a great one for going to live music performances. Around about 1980, I went through a bit of a phase, during which I saw Elvis Costello twice, Joe Jackson, The Radiators [from Space], The Police and a handful of other new-wave-type acts. Later in the 80s, during my marriage, I went to quite a few concerts in the National Concert Hall, Dublin. My then wife’s brother played in the RTE Symphony Orchestra, and gave us a steady supply of free or cheap tickets. In 1988, I moved to London and effectively gave up concerts in favour of theatre. I don’t think I went to hear live music again until 2006.</p><p>A couple of years before that, I’d rekindled a liking for jazz piano, initially as a result of hearing the Esbjörn Svensson Trio on Paul Gambaccini’s Jazz FM chart show and buying a few of their albums as a result. Shortly after I moved there, I realized that France provided no shortage of opportunities to hear EST and similar acts live. In fact, at the time, there were many subsidized jazz festivals in France. I started to go to some of them fairly regularly.</p><p>In jazz, live performance is particularly valued. I thought I remembered a quote from someone famous to the effect that a jazz performance is something that happens just once, in real time, without a rehearsal. (Unfortunately, I don’t remember it accurately enough to use Google as an aid to attribution.) As someone without a vivid episodic memory, I might not seem ideally placed to enjoy live, largely improvised music. And, in many ways, I’m not; but it’s a bit more complicated than it appears.</p><p>Most people who have aphantasia find that it’s not just their visual imagination that’s missing. The imagination related to their other senses tends to be affected similarly. That’s true of me too, but my auditory memory is relatively active. I can’t voluntarily recall a smell or a taste any better than I can an image but I can remember sounds. I tend to recognize voices rather than faces, tunes get stuck in my head, I can imagine the sound of a particular instrument, solo or in a group with others, and so on.</p><p>But, while I’m much better at remembering what I heard than what I saw or felt, I’m far from being able to reconstruct a live musical performance in memory. The experience of attending a concert consists of much more than the audio element. I’m not going to remember what I was wearing, where I was sitting in relation to the stage, how well I could see the musicians, how close the instruments were to each other, what the light was like or any of a large number of other factors which will have affected my perception of the performance. Given all this, it’s not all that surprising that, for most of my life, I haven’t shown much enthusiasm for attending gigs or concerts.</p><p>The period from 2005 to 2011, in France, was the longest exception to that rule. Not all of the performances I went to were in France itself, though most were, and France became a handy base for quick trips to some neighbouring countries. I went back to London to see the Marcin Wasilewski Trio at the Pizza Express in Dean Street, Aaron Parks in Ronnie Scott’s and Stefano Bollani in Kings Place; to Amsterdam to see John Taylor, Enrico Pieranunzi and others play solo in the Bimhuis, to the Umbria Jazz Festival in Perugia in 2009 (which I think is the first time Chick Corea and Stefano Bollani played together). I was ready to go to Hamburg to hear John Taylor’s superb trio with Palle Danielsson and Martin France, but the concert was sold out by the time I heard about it. (The trio was supporting Jack DeJohnette.)</p><p>I don’t remember any more than brief flashes of any of the performances I attended. Even the Brad Mehldau Trio in the Theâtre de la Mer, Sète, in July 2008, which I then thought and still think was the best concert I ever attended, has left only vague traces in my memory. </p><p>Most of these concerts were events that I travelled to. From Bordeaux to Antibes, Capbreton to Vernoux-en-Vivarais, Paris to Sète and Marciac to Vitrolles, I generally took a combination of bike and train to get to the venue. Even for events in nearby Toulouse (whose <a href=\"https://www.haute-garonne.fr/jazz-sur-son-31\">Jazz sur son 31</a> festival made October worth looking forward to), I often cycled the 60Km each way, rather than hop on a train, partly to make it seem more of an expedition. I now think that the travel helped me to build up a sense of anticipation, which in turn enhanced my enjoyment of the concert.</p><p>A sense of anticipation is something I tend not to experience spontaneously. The prospect of going to an event — a concert or dramatic performance, a party or celebration, least of all a sporting fixture — does not, in general, get me worked up to a pitch of excitement. I can’t say I <em>never</em> get excited about something that’s about to happen — of course I do — but usually not in the same circumstances as other people seem to. (Naturally, I can’t call to mind a particular occasion before which I felt excited, and so can’t examine what the differences were between that and a more humdrum “event”.)</p><p>I’ve often been puzzled by other people’s apparent ability to feel an anticipatory excitement. I used to wonder how they did it (or if they were faking it) and to some extent I envied their spontaneity. Since I’ve learned about aphantasia, I have (rather obviously) come to suspect that my inability to “picture” future events or incidents is at the root of my reduced capacity for excitement. I’ve written before about <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html\">not having much sense of the future</a> (any more than I have of the past, and for the same reasons). It’s not easy to get excited over something you can’t imagine visually.</p><p>So, it occurs to me that I may have been using certain incidental aspects of going to jazz performances in France — the relative unfamiliarity of the country, the language and the venues, the distances to be travelled — as a kind of counterbalance to the recognition (based on experience but not fully understood because I didn’t yet know about SDAM and aphantasia) that these performances would almost immediately fade from memory, leaving nothing behind but an inert, unevocative ticket stub?</p><p>Some <a href=\"https://www.sunset-sunside.com/concert/2020/10/\">live jazz performances are still taking place</a> during the current pandemic, but I have no intention of going to any of them. At the beginning of the restrictions, the Sunside/Sunset venue put up a notice on their website saying that their survival was threatened by the suspension of live performances. They reopened as soon as they could, <a href=\"https://artkavanagh.micro.blog/2020/06/19/venez-nombreux-et.html\">inviting their audience back in June</a>:</p><blockquote>Venez nombreux et masqués faire la fête du jazz …</blockquote><p>The Sunside is one of my very favourite venues, and I certainly would hate to see it go out of business. But it’s very small, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable sitting in it for an hour or more as part of an audience that outnumbered the band.</p><p>Perhaps the pandemic and its attendant restrictions are providing the necessary opportunity to think again about the way I listen to jazz. People who know about jazz, as I’ve suggested above, believe that this is music that should be listened to live, in the moment, as it is created. It’s played by improvisors who, as they play, bring into existence a unique, new work. Its audience should likewise be experiencing, in the moment, something that has never been heard before and that can never (even if it’s recorded) be heard again <em>in the same way</em>.</p><p>If this opinion is correct, I’ve never remotely resembled the ideal listener to jazz. Rather than pay full attention to a one-time-only performance, I listen constantly, repeatedly and with a fluctuating level of concentration to <em>recordings</em> of such performances. It’s not unusual for these to be live albums. Even when they’re not live, they’re very often single-take, unedited studio recordings with no overdubs. The tracks for individual instruments may be remixed, the sound balance adjusted, echo removed and other sound engineering techniques employed, but the notes, chords, rests etc are those actually played by the musicians. So, I’m listening to a recording of a performance that really happened, not an assemblage of clips and edits.</p><p>But, unlike the performance, the process of listening happens over and over and over again. I’ve occasionally felt obscurely guilty about that, as if I were a kind of fraud. (But on the other hand, why would anybody buy an album with the intention of listening to it only once?) It’s likely that the way I listen to jazz from now on will not change very much. But, because of a combination of the pandemic restrictions and the recognition that my unresisted impulse to return to France was probably caused by my deficient episodic memory, I expect that the way I <em>feel</em> about how I listen to jazz will change fundamentally. I’ll certainly continue to listen to albums, both live and studio, many times each.</p><p>At some point, when I’m convinced it’s safe to do so, I’m sure I’ll start going to live  performances again. Maybe not in France and probably, now that Brexit is a reality, not in London. But I’ve wanted to go back to the Bimhuis since the first time I was there. And though I’ll never have another opportunity to hear John Taylor play live, I’d still like to visit some of the well known German venues sooner or later. The difference is I’ll know that my memories of these events will soon afterwards fade from “episodic” to “semantic”. I hope that, now that I know a bit more about how my mind works, I’ll resist the temptation to go back to somewhere I lived before, in futile pursuit of these elusive recollections.</p>",

			"title": "The books I left behind — and some I didn’t",
			"content_html": "<p>When I returned to Ireland in 2011, I left a lot of my possessions in my sister’s attic near Toulouse. This included a HP LaserJet printer, an amplifier and two speakers, a substantial CD collection (most of which I had ripped to iTunes, so I no longer needed the physical media), a television and some DVDs. But most of what I left behind were books. Many of them were general reading: fiction of varying degrees of seriousness as well as some popular nonfiction. There were also the books I had been using in my doctoral work on Andrew Marvell. These fell into three categories: literary criticism and scholarship, seventeenth-century political and constitutional history, and some more specialized topics, notably the argument between Grotius and Selden on the international law of the sea. All in all, there were several heavy boxes of sometimes weighty tomes. Although I had occasionally gone back to retrieve a particular book or two, they had for the most part rested undisturbed for the last nine years.</p><p>On Thursday, having come to the conclusion that I could neither leave them there indefinitely nor find a suitable permanent place for them all, I went through the boxes to sort out which books I absolutely wanted to keep and which I was prepared to leave to be dumped/donated/sold/whatever. There were a few difficult decisions but generally the process turned out to be much easier than I’d been expecting.</p><h3>Fiction</h3><p>I took everything by Michael Dibdin that I could find, including the first seven books in his Aurelio Zen series (or all but one of them: I’m not sure I found <cite>Dead Lagoon</cite>). I’ve been meaning for a long time to write something about Zen’s moral trajectory over the course of the series. I have the last three books in Ireland, so <cite>And Then You Die</cite> may be the only one I’m missing. (It, of course, is central to my argument: the nadir of the trajectory.)</p><p>I left behind the first four or five of Jeff Lindsay’s Dexter series, even though I have two of the later novels in Ireland. I had a vague idea of rereading them to confirm (or not) my impression that they’re satires in which the self-described “monster” repeatedly fails to recognize that he isn’t really any morally worse than the unending stream of ordinary psychopaths, egotists and narcissists from among whom he chooses his victims.</p><p>I took most of the Scott Turow novels I could find, including my disintegrating paperback copy of <cite>The Burden of Proof</cite>, which could do with being replaced anyway. (I still think it’s his best novel, though it has competition from <cite>Personal Injuries</cite>.) The two I didn’t take were <cite>The Laws of Our Fathers</cite> (an ambitious failure, in my view) and <cite>Pleading Guilty</cite> (which I love and will certainly reread). The first of these was showing signs of damp and the second is a trade paperback, which I’ll replace with a more manageable mass market paperback when necessary. I don’t remember seeing <cite>Ordinary Heroes</cite>, which I know I had in hardback. I wonder what happened to it.</p><p>I took Wilkie Collins’s <cite>Armadale</cite> but left behind several other books of his, including <cite>The Moonstone</cite>, <cite>Basil</cite> and <cite>The Law and the Lady</cite>. I’m not entirely sure why I left them: I’d certainly like to read <cite>Basil</cite> again, at least.</p><p>I decided to keep everything I could find by Andrew Taylor except <cite>Caroline Minuscule</cite>, which I’ve already reread to death (another disintegrating paperback).</p><p>I’ve wanted to reread Ian McEwan’s <cite>Enduring Love</cite> almost since I originally read it, so I was glad to get it back. The only other book by McEwan that I took was <cite>Amsterdam</cite>, a very slim volume. My battered, 32-year-old copy of <cite>The Child in Time</cite> needs to be replaced, <cite>The Innocent</cite> is an unwieldy trade paperback and I’m probably never going to read <cite>Atonement</cite> again. My copy of <cite>Saturday</cite> is already in Ireland.</p><p>Note: Enduring Love and Amsterdam: I have said before (too often) that McEwan won the Booker <em>with</em> <cite>Amsterdam</cite> but <em>for</em> the immediately preceding <cite>Enduring Love</cite>, much as Peter Carey won with <cite>Oscar and Lucinda</cite> but for <cite>Illywhacker</cite>.</p><p>The first two books by Peter Abrahams that I read were <cite>Oblivion</cite> and <cite>Nerve Damage</cite>. I took both, though I’ve reread <cite>Oblivion</cite> probably more than once. I’m looking forward to my second read of <cite>Nerve Damage</cite>.</p><p>I decided to keep <cite>Dubliners</cite> but left behind <cite>A Portrait of the Artist</cite>, even though I believe that Joyce is a much better novelist than he is a short story writer. I suspect that <cite>Dubliners</cite> wouldn’t get as much attention as it does if it weren’t the more accessible work of an author whose novels are certainly difficult. Perhaps I kept <cite>Dubliners</cite> so that I can again test that suspicion. And why couldn’t I find my copy of <cite>Ulysses</cite>?</p><h3>Nonfiction</h3><p>I left behind a lot of nonfiction. I had long intended to reread John Lanchester’s <cite>Whoops! Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay</cite> but I probably should have done so before its moment passed. The same with Cass Sunstein and Richard Epstein, <cite>The Vote</cite> and Ian Ayres, <cite>Supercrunchers</cite>. (Remember, these books have been lying there since 2011.) I <em>did</em> retrieve Steven Pinker’s <cite>The Language Instinct</cite>, but nothing else of his. In fact, I couldn’t see any other books by him, though my enthusiasm for <cite>The Language Instinct</cite> led me to binge-read several of his books in the mid 2000s, including <cite>How the Mind Works</cite> and <cite>The Blank Slate</cite>. Where did they all get to? I’m beginning to wonder if there isn’t an overlooked a box that I forgot to open.</p><h3>Literary criticism</h3><p>One book I was particularly keen to recover was Christopher Ricks’s <cite>Essays in Appreciation</cite>, which includes his brilliant reading of <cite>Doctor Faustus</cite>, inspired by William Empson’s highly idiosyncratic one.</p><p>As for Empson himself, I abandoned a lot: everything, in fact, except <cite>Seven Types of Ambiguity</cite> and <cite>Milton’s God</cite>. Again, I’m not sure why I made this choice: I think it was more instinctive than thought out. Perhaps I felt that there was a risk of letting Empson overshadow my future work. I’ve wanted for almost 25 years to write about his interpretation of <cite>Faustus</cite>. If I write anything else to do with Empson, it will be about his essay on Marvell’s marriage, where he arrived (apparently by instinct) at something very close to the truth, by way of a series of factual mistakes, unsupported assumptions and misreadings of historical records. I already have what I need for those two pieces.</p><p>Where Marvell is concerned, I couldn’t possibly leave behind Rosalie Colie’s <cite>My Ecchoing Song: Andrew Marvell’s Poetry of Criticism</cite>, but there was plenty that I <em>did</em> leave, including a box of photocopies of scholarly articles, and many solid, valuable, hardback books in good condition. Thinking about it a day later I was quite impressed, but also a little horrified, at my own ruthlessness. I’ll try to explain <em>why</em> I was so ruthless in the next section.</p><h3>History</h3><p>As far as I remember, I took almost nothing that falls into this category. I know I hesitated over the three volumes of Richard Tuck’s edition of Hugo Grotius, <cite>The Rights of War and Peace</cite>. They had been expensive and would be hard to replace, but on the other hand they are very bulky and I couldn’t be sure that I’d ever need to consult them again. Other substantial books I left behind included Glenn Burgess, <cite>Absolute Monarchy and the Stuart Constitution</cite>, J. G. A. Pocock’s <cite>The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law</cite> and quite a bit more in or near the same vein.</p><p>In each case, my thinking was that I <em>now</em> want to write about Marvell from an accessible, critical perspective rather than a rigorous, scholarly, historical one. This is not in the least to disparage rigorous historical scholarship. I admire it hugely and recognize that it’s the indispensible underpinning without which a great deal of criticism would be nothing more than groundless speculation. But the fact is that I (like most people, I imagine) am much better at groundless speculation than I am at rigorous scholarship and having made an attempt at the latter while I was writing my thesis, I now wish to concentrate my attention on the former. </p><h3>Poetry</h3><p>I saved the <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/poetry-scholarly-editions.html\">Margoliouth/Legouis edition</a> of Marvell’s <cite>Poems and Letters</cite>. I didn’t think it was acceptable to separate the volumes and take the Poems but not the Letters, so I made room for the latter. I also got William Empson’s <cite>Collected Poems</cite>, apparently undamaged, though some other books in the same box were showing the effects of damp. One of these was the Norton edition of Robert Browning’s poetry. I think I decided to take it anyway, though I don’t clearly remember packing it. In general, I don’t like the Norton editions very much: in this one the pages are too narrow in proportion to their length and it’s too tightly bound. But I need some kind of edition of Browning and this will do in a pinch. I took my hardback <cite>New Oxford Book of Victorian Verse</cite> edited by Christopher Ricks, but left the Penguin Classic edition of Arthur Hugh Clough.</p><p>To my surprise, I didn’t hesitate to take Yeats. (Perhaps I felt that I haven’t finished with him yet.) I also took Auden and Larkin, but not Eliot, Hardy, Herrick, Donne or Milton. I particularly wanted to find my copy of <cite>Selected Poems of Louis MacNeice</cite> but there was no sign of it. Another volume in the hypothetical overlooked box? Anyway, that gives me all the excuse I need to buy that or a different edition of MacNeice’s poetry.</p><h3>A glaring absence?</h3><p>I see that all but one of the authors I’ve mentioned are men. That gives a misleading impression of my current reading habits. In fact, I did pack some books by women but just one book each: Sophie Hannah, Karin Alvtegen, Melissa Bank, Emily Brontë and Rebecca Goldstein (now that I think of it, two in her case, one fiction, one non) are the names that immediately come to mind. I would have taken Kate Atkinson’s <cite>Case Histories</cite> or <cite>One Good Turn</cite> if I’d found either of them but they must be in the overlooked box. I hesitated over Zadie Smith’s <cite>White Teeth</cite> but in the end decided to leave it.</p><p>So that’s it. Inevitably not a perfect choice, since I can’t predict exactly what books I’m going to want to read again in the future or which ones I may need to refer to. But I feel that I’ve freed the ones I selected from the collective weight of their never-again-to-be-read fellows, as well as from their inaccessible location at the back of an attic in Occitanie. That feeling has put a certain lightness in my step in the few days since.</p>",

			"title": "Where to now for RSS?",
			"content_html": "<p>I stopped using RSS around the same time that Google closed Google Reader, but not <em>because</em> of that. As far as I remember, I hadn’t really been aware of Google Reader till I read the announcement of its end. I’ve never really liked web-based readers or used them much: I preferred an approach that allowed me to read feeds in the browser (as both Safari and IE11 did) and it was when Safari dropped that feature that I gave up on feeds, a decision reinforced by the fact that I was then relying more on Twitter to let me know when updates had been posted.</p><p>Then, two years ago, I read that Brent Simmons had resumed ownership of NetNewsWire and was working on a new version. At the time I was without a Mac, so I decided to try Reeder 3 on iPad, while waiting for NetNewsWire to be released on that platform. I later upgraded to Reeder 4 and I’m now happily using the iPad version of NetNewsWire, without syncing. It’s nice to be back.</p><p>I have some reservations about RSS, though. First, I suppose, is the fact that it’s in XML, which I’ve always thought to be unnecessarily complex for many (obviously not all) of the uses it’s been put to. Brent Simmons (again) and Manton Reece have demonstrated this point by creating the specification for <a href=\"https://www.jsonfeed.org/\">JSON Feed</a>, which is a lot more straightforward. My own site consists of static web pages (including this post) from which I can’t automatically generate a feed, so I’ve been offering just a JSON Feed, which I update by hand whenever I post something new.</p><p>I include the full text of the relevant web page as HTML, something that is allowed for in the specification. This has brought it home to me that there’s a degree of duplication, which should ideally be avoided.</p><p>My second reservation is that the RSS approach depends on individual readers <em>following</em> the feeds of sites they want to be updated about. I’m personally <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/following.html\">not very taken with the “following” model</a>. It strikes me as too insistent, too FOMO, almost obsessive. I’m not going to read <em>everything</em> that <a href=\"https://memex.naughtons.org/feed\">John Naughton</a> or <a href=\"https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/feed/\">Richard Murphy</a> posts (probably not even most of it), and if there were an alternative I wouldn’t want to be notified every time they put out something new. On the other hand, I’m even less keen that an algorithm should choose which posts it’s going to tell me about. Experience with Twitter, Facebook and other social media suggests that algorithms really aren’t very good at this. Ideally, I’d like my browser to pop up an unobtrusive notification saying something like “You haven’t visited <a href=\"https://alanralph.co.uk/feed/\">Alan Ralph’s site</a> for a few weeks. There are some new posts. Would you like to take a look?”</p><p>The third reservation is that your feed reader presents everything in the same style. If we’re going to read every story in black San Francisco on a white background, why should anybody bother paying attention to what their site looks like? If the design and style are more than just incidental decoration, shouldn’t we be reading the page in its intended setting? (Not everybody would agree with this, of course. On Micro.blog, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Miraz/\">@Miraz</a> said that she has set her Safari preferences so that <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Miraz/10297173\">sites open in Reader View by default</a>.)</p><p>So, I think what I’d like to see is that feeds and updates should be handled by the browser, which will know whenever a page/site is updated. The individual would be able to add URLs to a list of sites to be watched. Ideally, it shouldn’t be necessary for the browser to poll these sites more often than 2 or 3 times a week. Many of the sites on the watch list would be infrequently updated. (That’s why they need to be on the list in the first place.) In those cases, the person should be notified of each update. In the case of busier sites, an occasional reminder should be issued if she hasn’t visited the site in a while.</p><p>If the individual decides to visit the updated page, it should be displayed in the browser in the usual way. Journalists and others who need to keep on top of a rapidly changing field would still need feed readers but the rest of us would, I think, find it more convenient to be reminded of updates in our browsers.</p><p>Similar approaches have been tried before. Mozilla discontinued Live Bookmarks in Firefox, presumably because the feature wasn’t used enough to justify the cost of maintaining it. In any case, it was effectively an RSS feed reader, whereas what I’m suggesting would mean incorporating feed elements directly into the web page.</p><p>There’s also Kicks Condor’s browser extension, <a href=\"https://fraidyc.at\">Fraidy Cat</a>, which is a lot of fun but, again, relies in part on RSS feeds and anyway looks like a (brilliant) browser extension rather than a feature that is wholly integrated into the browser.</p><p>The difference between what I’m suggesting and the current system of notifications is that notifications are initiated by the publisher, not the reader. In my proposal, the individual would choose in her own good time what to add to the watch list, whereas under the present system the site asks for permission to show notifications, perhaps at a moment when she doesn’t want to think about that because she’s busy trying to read a post.

			"content_html": "<h2>I may have been trying to relive my experiences in actuality because I can’t recapture them in memory</h2><p>I’ve just spent the last 7 weeks living in a succession of cheapish hotels in Pau and Tarbes, towns in the southern French regions of Nouvelle Aquitaine and Occitanie respectively. I had intended to move from Ireland to France back in March, but then the restrictions on movement were suddenly introduced, and I ended up spending 5 months as an unvited guest in my sister’s house in Dublin. So, once the restrictions were lifted, I had to move quickly.</p><p>A lot of my time over this 7-week period has been spent trying and repeatedly failing to rent a studio apartment for the next year. I don’t intend to bore you with the reasons why I can’t find a place to live but, partly because of them, I think I’ve lost my enthusiasm for living in France.</p><p>I spent 6 months in Bordeaux in 2015 and found somewhere to stay within 10 days. The difference is that, at that time, I was looking for a houseshare, whereas now (partly because of the virus, but also because I’d like to have my own place to myself) I’m trying to find a studio apartment. I’d have expected that people would be more wary about sharing their own homes than about letting out an impersonal property asset, but I got that quite wrong.</p><p>So where do I go from here? There are practical problems about going back to Ireland (I’d have to have somewhere to wait out 14 days’ isolation, for a start, and then find a place to live long-term). And then there are the emotional obstacles.</p><p>In 2011, I moved back to Ireland, having lived outside the country for 24 years, 18 of those in London. Throughout my time away, I had felt nostalgic for Dublin — for that city specifically, not for Ireland as a country. But I wasn’t able to attach that feeling of nostalgia to any particular place, event or experience. (From this point on, I’m going to refer to that feeling as “unspecific nostalgia” for reasons that I hope will become clear.) </p><p>I used to say to a very good friend of mine from Holland (who also lived in London and who died in 2006) that he must come to Dublin; he’d really like it. What would he like about it? he would ask me. I’d go blank. It was hard to say what was so good about the place, apart from a fleeting feeling as one walked along a particular street. It was a generalized atmosphere, impossible to put one’s finger on. But he’d see when he got there. (As it turned out, he never did.)</p><p>When I’d go back for visits (and for my mother’s funeral in 1999), the anticipated generalized atmosphere and fleeting feelings would elude me; but I’d tell myself that this was because I was just passing through, it would be different if I were living there every day. So, when the chance to return to Ireland came up at the end of 2011, I took it.</p><p>I soon began to believe I’d made a dreadful mistake. Dublin was not the place it had been in my imagination. (It hardly could have been, because my imagination was, as I later discovered, incorrigibly nonvisual, and therefore the incapable of capturing certain fundamental characteristics of the place.) Again, it was hard to put my finger on what exactly was wrong. The colours were all off, for a start. The trees were too green to be natural (as, indeed, were many things.) To me, the air in Dublin suggested an alien atmosphere, tinged with a purplish blue, possibly poisonous and certainly inimical to life, whereas that in France had been warm, brown and orange, welcoming. I had to get out of Ireland and go back to France.</p><p>Again, brief visits should have allowed me to view my fantasies with a clearer eye. I spent a few days at a time in France in each of the three years following my return to Ireland, mainly for jazz performances (the Brad Mehldau trio near Toulon, several pianists in Marciac, Enrico Pieranunzi at the Sunside and Martial Solal in Aix) but also for my youngest sister’s 50th birthday. The France of brief visits didn’t match that of my nostalgic imagination but that didn’t stop me from wanting to back permanently.</p><p>I’ve also just recently noticed that I’ve been feeling an inclination to return to London, which I’d happily left for good in 2005 (and again in 2006). I think a pattern is becoming clear, according to which I develop unspecific nostalgia for places where I used to live, and this nostalgia makes itself felt in the form of a strong desire to go back to that place and relive the experiences I had there. I know, theoretically, that the past can’t be relived. I believe it’s because of this cognitive awareness that I didn’t attempt to move back to Dublin during the 1990s or 2000s, despite the feeling that I’d be happier there than in London or France. The feeling was always resistible — until 2012 when it hit me with a double whammy: I was back in Ireland at last, simultaneously “missing” France and learning that the Dublin that I thought I’d been pining after for the past 24 years had very little correspondence with reality.</p><p>Of course, when I was living in London in the 1990s and longing for an idealized but vague and curiously featureless idea of Dublin, or in Dublin in the early 2010s, desperately missing an equally abstract notion of France, I didn’t yet know that I have <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2db66c17c5f3\">SDAM</a>: I learned about that only in 2018. Now that I’ve been back to France with an awareness of that condition, and have again found it a disappointment, I’m speculating that the mismatch between my expectations and observable reality has something to do with my lack of vivid memories and my inability to form mental images.</p><p>I now suspect that the unspecific nostalgia comes from feelings of pleasure, enjoyment and validation that were originally stimulated by incidents and experiences that I can’t remember except as forming part of a dry, featureless narrative. The feelings are still there, even though they’re not attached to memories, as I assume they would be for someone who doesn’t have SDAM. Lacking a grounding in memory, they’ve instead become associated in my mind with the abstract notion of the place (Dublin, certain parts of France). Not being able to relive the experiences in memory, I’m drawn to try to relive them in actuality, which of course is not possible.</p><p>Now that I think I know what’s happening, I should be better able to resist the urge to “go back”. The attempt to substitute equivalent new experiences for my nonexistent episodic memories is irrational and doomed, but it has taken me at least the last 9 years to understand that. I thought I was missing France or Dublin. In fact, what I lacked were the memories of incidents that had occurred in these places.</p><p>The lesson to be learned from this is that it doesn’t matter where I live. Wherever it might be, I’ll have some good experiences, and some not-so-good ones there. While I’ll certainly remember that some of them happened, I won’t remember them in such a way as to recall them to mind, or “relive” them. The good experiences will evoke pleasant feelings which will not, unfortunately, be connected to memories of the occasions that gave rise to them, and will therefore merge into another bout of unspecific nostalgia. There’s nothing I can do about it but recognize it for what it is.</p><p>I’ve been attaching too much importance to the question <em>where</em> I want to live. Really, the important thing now is to find a room <em>some</em>where with a desk, a chair, a reasonable amount of space for the books I need in the medium term, and a supply of electricity and water. I have at least one book and several shorter writing projects that I’d like to finish while I can still write. They’re <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html\">my priority now</a>. I don’t want to spend any more time looking for the ideal surroundings in which to write them.</p><p>It may even be the case that being in the “wrong” place, the place where I don’t want to be, may be good for my writing. 2012, the year of the double whammy, when I was at my most unhappy since I left school 38 years previously, was the year when I finally finished, submitted and defended my doctoral thesis and got started on <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1093/escrit/cgw006\">the publication of which I’m most proud</a> (so far). I continued to work on that essay over the following year and in 2014 I wrote the first draft of <cite>A Falling Body</cite>.</p><p>From the beginning of 2016 through to September 2019, I was flat broke and living in a borrowed apartment in a dull, uninspiring Irish town where I wrote <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">several short stories</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss\">critical discussion of books and ficton</a> and my posts about <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html\">aphantasia/SDAM</a> as well as a bunch of more ephemeral stuff. So, if writing is really to be my priority from now on, maybe it’s time I went looking for a bare, cheap studio or bedsit (if such a thing is to be found) in another uninteresting Irish town. But first, I need to figure out what to do about the 14 days’ isolation. Je vous tiendrai au courant.</p>",
