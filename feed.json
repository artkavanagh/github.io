			"title": "A good masculinity is hard to find: Part 2 — gender as identity",
			"content_html": "<p>In <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/a-good-masculinity-anti\">part 1 of this series of posts</a>, I recalled that a trans woman who commented on an old post of mine had two main points to make against it. First, if I didn’t want to be described as “cisgender”, it was up to me to come up with an alternative term. The phrase I eventually settled on is “antimasculine male”, and I’ll have more to say in part 3 about why I've adopted that terminology. Her second point was that my post was entirely focused on gender <em>roles</em>, and that I “needed” to think about gender <em>identity</em> too. That’s the point I want to deal with in this part.</p><p>She was right: I hadn’t until then thought about gender as identity, though I had been thinking regularly (sometimes, it seemed, almost obsessively) about gender for at least thirty-five years. So I began to try to look at the subject from this new perspective.</p><p>I found that I was contemplating gender identity from the point of view of an outsider. I quickly discovered that <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/e0c93850ffb1\">a sense of gender identity is something that I personally don’t have</a>, which is one good reason why I’d never previously paid it any attention. I’ve speculated that this might be because I don’t have a visual imagination (or, in consequence, any kind of visual self-image). I haven’t been able to find a completely convincing answer to that puzzle, but I have learned that <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/d337512176d\">the “lack” of a sense of gender identity isn’t all that unusual</a>.</p><p>But thinking about gender identity from this outsider’s viewpoint has led me to speculate whether the astonishing virulence and vituperation of the online (and real-world) battles between so-called TERFs (mainly veteran feminists), on the one hand, and trans rights activists on the other has to do with a clash of contested identities.</p><p>When I was a teenager and in my early 20s in 1970s Ireland, it was vanishingly rare to hear an adult human female described as a “woman”. If she was under, say, 38, she was most likely to be a “girl”. Alternative terms were bird, chick, dollybird, cheescake, a bit of fluff/stuff and so on ad infinitum. There were fewer terms for older women but for the most part they didn’t include “woman”: auld wan (one) and auld biddy are the first two that come to mind. I can remember as a 20-year-old in university, feeling awkward about using the word “women” in relation to my female fellow students when “girls” seemed to be the more socially permissible term. Even today, there are some circles in which I’m cautious about calling a woman who plays a role on stage or screen an “actor”, in preference to the diminutive form of that word which is still commonly imposed on female dramatic performers.</p><p>In short, the identity of “woman” wasn’t one that the adult human females of the 1970s and 80s could expect would be easily accorded to them as their birthright. It had to be asserted, struggled for, fought over and repeatedly, exhaustingly, interminably insisted upon. Is it surprising that the women who played a part in establishing that identity should now be unwilling to give it up easily?</p><p>If you read J&nbsp;K&nbsp;Rowling’s <a href=\"https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/\">recent post</a> <em>as she wrote it</em>, rather than through the lens of trans rights activists’ assumptions about the kind of thing a TERF is likely to say, I think it’s clear that her concern is not to express bigotry towards or hatred of trans people but rather to protest against the erasure of the hard-won identity of “woman” as meaning adult human female. Here is some of what she has to say:</p><blockquote>We’re living through the most misogynistic period I’ve experienced … Never have I seen women denigrated and dehumanised to the extent they are now. From the leader of the free world’s long history of sexual assault accusations and his proud boast of “grabbing them by the pussy”, to the incel (“involuntarily celibate”) movement that rages against women who won’t give them sex, to the trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating, men across the political spectrum seem to agree: women are asking for trouble. Everywhere, women are being told to shut up and sit down, or else.</blockquote><p>You might not agree that the present state of the world threatens and attacks women (women in general, that is, not only trans women) but you surely must accept that Rowling has good reasons for her concerns. And, if you think that that calling out “trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching” is inexcusable exaggeration, just search Twitter for “punch a TERF” and prepare to be appalled. What you will see is the threat of (sometimes extreme) violence against people who are unquestionably women by people who (though some of them repudiate a <em>male identity</em>) are behaving in an undeniably masculine manner. Rowling adds:</p><blockquote>It’s also clear that one of the objectives of denying the importance of sex is to erode what some seem to see as the cruelly segregationist idea of women having their own biological realities or — just as threatening — unifying realities that make them a cohesive political class.</blockquote><p>It should be obvious from this that her purpose is not to be horrid to people who are struggling bravely under the burden of gender dysphoria, but to assert the importance of women (in the admittedly contested sense of human females) as an indispensable political force in a world that’s facing a whole series of crises.</p><p>Twitter is obviously not the ideal place to conduct a nuanced argument but even by its standards there’s been a remarkable amount of “reading in” to her tweets. In the one that sparked the current shouting match, she suggested that phrases like “people who menstruate” (or, by analogy, “pregnant people”) tend to erase women’s identity. Is she wrong?</p><p>I haven’t discussed the subjects of menstruation or the possibility of pregnancy with any trans men, but I’m fairly certain that for most trans men menstruation and pregnancy are not essential parts of their identity or self-conception. I doubt very much if many of them would feel offended or excluded by the use of terms like “menstruating women” or “pregnant women”. It’s clear, surely, that the overwhelming majorities of people who menstruate or who are pregnant are going to be women, so why should it be considered hateful or bigoted to talk about “women” in this context, unless as part of a project to make adult females less visible?</p><p>I hope I don’t need to point out that it’s a logical fallacy to infer that because people who menstruate are (by and large) women that therefore all women menstruate. But of course Rowling’s tweet about menstruating people wasn’t her only “offence”. I’m tempted to go into her expressed views about Maya Forstater’s sacking or the difficulties faced by detransitioners, but I’m afraid that each of these subjects would require its own post.</p><img src=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/stfu-terf.jpg\" alt=\"STFU TERF\" width=\"640\" height=\"805\"><p>So instead, I’d like to return to the question of misogyny. There’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/78e01dca68d\">a Medium post</a> by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rebeccarc/\">boodleoops</a> who assembles a collection of screenshots of the Twitter attacks on Rowling. Some of them can be seen in the image above, but there are many more, and worse. Tweet after tweet tells Rowling to “shut the fuck up”, describes her as a TERF and a cunt, speculates as to how much her “pussy” stinks and/or has dried up, and invites her to choke on a trans girl’s dick.</p><p>How can anybody imagine that this vicious outpouring is prompted by anything <em>other than</em> misogyny? The hatred of women and disgust at female bodies is palpable throughout these tweets. Several are variants on “JK Rowling can choke on my fat trans cock”. Is it really credible that the persona behind this, who positively exults both in having a “cock” or a “dick” and in the prospect of using it as a weapon to silence a woman, either has a feminine gender identity or experiences dysphoria at having been assigned a masculine one?</p><p>I wrote “persona”, rather than “individual” because it occurs to me that some of the most offensive of these tweets may be the work, not of sincere trans rights activists, but of bots or alt-right trolls who relish the opportunity to set feminists and other ostensibly progressive people at each others’ throats. But whoever is responsible for this invective, it’s violently misogynist and ought to be rejected out of hand by anyone who calls herself a woman, whether trans or not.</p><p>The clash of identities often leads to irreconcilable and mutually contradictory claims, not just when it comes to questions of sex and gender but also in areas such as national identity. Usually, there’s no impartial, objective authority to whom a final, decisive appeal may be made, so the conflict may be irresolvable. In the dispute between veteran feminists (those who remember a time before adult human females were “women”) and trans activists, most of whom seem unable to conceive of any reason apart from “bigotry” why anyone might want to deny that trans women are female, I find myself uneasily on the side of the former, notwithstanding my self-description as “antimasculine”. This is because, for most of my adult life, I’ve been accustomed to think of gender <em>not</em> as identity but rather as <em>behaviour</em>, specifically as certain clusters of behaviours that were more or less masculine or feminine. In the third part of this series of posts, I’m planning to reexamine my long-held concept of gender-as-behaviour, to see whether it still has anything useful to tell us.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>About three years ago, I posted a piece (which I’ve since deleted) on Medium, attempting to explain why I don’t like to be described as “cisgender”. That post drew responses from several trans women (one of whom, ironically enough, accused me of “cisplaining”). Another made two telling points. First, she said it was OK not to want to use the term cisgender, but it was my responsibility to come up with an alternative. I didn’t have an immediate answer. It took a while but eventually I found a self-description that I’m happy with. The term is “antimasculine male”. (I’ll attempt to deal with her second point in part 2.)</p><p>Since reading the responses to that Medium post, I’ve been trying on and off to write something describing my thoughts, feelings and beliefs on the subject of gender. Each time, I find my argument drifting into a more theoretical and dogmatic stance than I meant it to. J&nbsp;K&nbsp;Rowling’s recent tweets <a href=\"https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/\">and post</a> about trans men, women and activists has persuaded me that I need to try again. What follows below is <em>not</em> my latest attempt. It has occurred to me more than once that the main problem with the posts I’ve been drafting is that they’ve tended to be abstract and impersonal. Maybe, instead of writing about masculinity and femininity, (and men and women) in general, I needed to write about myself in particular.</p> <p>I can think of three times in my life when something closely related to my gender has been in question to some degree. The most recent of these happened more than 30 years ago, when I was on honeymoon in Paris. My then wife and I were staying in a two-star hotel on the Boulevard St Michel, in a room which had a partial view of Nôtre Dame. The room didn’t have its own w.c. or shower, so I had to go along the corridor to use them. I didn’t then and still don’t wear pyjamas, and I was travelling lightish, without my own dressing-gown. Rather than put my clothes back on, I borrowed my wife’s dressing-gown which was pink and obviously meant to be worn by a woman.</p><p>On my return to the room, my wife snapped a picture of me, using an old Kodak Instamatic which was the only camera we had at the time. When we were back in Dublin and the photos were developed, some weeks later, we were showing the honeymoon pictures to some of her friends.</p><p>“Who’s the girl?” one of them asked.</p><p>“Oh, that’s Art”, my wife answered.</p><p>I had at the time curly, brown hair which I was wearing long. I looked at the picture: in it I really <em>did</em> look like a young woman, one with a narrow, tapering face. I assume I was embarrassed, but what I most remember about the incident now is being pleased that I had “passed” — albeit in a poor quality, autofocused snapshot — and without a wig or makeup.</p><p>The previous time was nearly 15 years earlier. I was about 14 and I’d gone to the races with my aunt and some of her friends. I was coming out of the Gents and a man passing me in the opposite direction stopped dead and did a double-take, then looked up at the sign to make sure he was going into the right place. At that time, too, I had long, curly, brown hair and I was wearing faded denim jeans and a more-or-less matching light blue poloneck jumper (sweater). I think I probably had my arms folded, possibly giving the impression of a girl self-consciously hiding her breasts. I <em>was</em> self-conscious, partly because I was tall and skinny and didn’t know where to keep my arms and hands. The man’s reaction made my self-consciousness worse and I worried about what kind of image I was projecting. That incident, the least consequential of the three, was possibly the one I found most disconcerting.</p><p>The earliest time may have been the most significant in its long-term effects. When I was five years old, I was in the “High Infants” class in the local primary school. I can’t remember why, but we all had to take off our outer clothes. Presumably it was because we needed to be vaccinated or treated for headlice or some similar infestation. To the best of my recollection, it was something “medical”. Suddenly, it seemed that everyone was pointing at me and laughing. “Kavanagh has girl’s underpants”, more than one person said. I blushed and hotly denied it, but the more I insisted that there was nothing out of the ordinary about my underwear, the less I managed to persuade anyone, and the angrier I got. I had a dizzying sense that the situation had slipped irretrievably out of my control and that <em>I shoudn’t have allowed this to happen</em>, if I’d been paying attention properly. In the end, I probably had a meltdown. I went home at lunchtime and told my mother what had happened. She assured me that my underwear was perfectly gender-appropriate and I went back to school after lunch in a jubilant mood, armed with the facts and ready to set my classmates straight.</p><p>It didn’t work. Even my mother’s authoritative pronouncement didn’t manage to outweigh the evidence of my classmates’ own eyes. The difference between the boys’ underwear and the girls’ was insignificant but easily detectable. In both cases, the garments were plain white cotton, but while the girls’ had Aertex-style little perforations, the boys’ had a combed effect, resulting in stripes like a carefully mown lawn. (Or maybe it was the other way around. In any case, there was an obvious distinction.) And there was no denying that mine, uniquely among the boys, fit the same pattern as the girls’. My mother was wrong and the collective wisdom of High Infants had been vindicated.</p><p>It was a heady experience for a five-year-old. The embarrassment and humiliation of having been exposed to the whole class as a secret (if unwitting) crossdresser seemed almost literally unbearable, yet I couldn’t see that I had any choice but to bear it. I felt a sense of dismay so excruciating that it seemed impossible that I could continue to exist. This <em>couldn’t</em> be happening. I wanted to run away from the school and never come back. But, at the same time, I was turned on by the experience. The terrible humiliation was also unexpectedly arousing. As you can imagine, this was an unfamiliar sensation to me as a five-year-old.</p><p>Did this actually happen? I’m 99 point something percent sure that it did, though I have to admit that it seems unlikely that a class of 5-year-old boys and girls would be asked to get partly undressed in the course of the school day. I can remember the short-lived sense of relief as I walked back to school after lunch, with my mother’s assurance that, no, I was not wearing girl’s underwear. There was a particular boy (whose name I remember) who managed to quell the jeering of the others. I remember asking him the following day for advice on how to behave towards those classmates. To the best of my recollection his advice was to carry on as normal and try to live it down. I know I was disappointed. I had been hoping he knew of a way to roll back time and make this thing not have happened: to allow events to unfold the way they <em>ought</em> to have done, not the way they had. An escape into a parallel universe would have been acceptable.</p><p>Momentous though the experience was, I seem to have forgotten about it very quickly. I went through school, my teenage years, university, early work life and my marriage without ever consciously thinking about the incident. When, in my 30s, the memory resurfaced, I was astonished that it could have remained buried or hidden for so long. At the time, I thought I must have suppressed the recollection as traumatic. Only recently, much later, have I come to see that missing childhood memories don’t require any special explanation. I have “<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2db66c17c5f3\">severely deficient autobiographical memory</a>” (SDAM), or <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/c48404d656c4\">something closely approaching it</a>. As a result, I don’t have <em>any</em> vivid childhood memories, or much in the way of vivid memories from any other period of my life. All the memories I have of my childhood, including my classmates’ ridicule of my underwear at the age of 5, are in the nature of bare narratives. I may remember <em>that</em> something happened but not how people looked, where they were sitting or standing, how the room was lit or decorated, or much of what was said. I usually don’t even know who was there, unless it’s particularly relevant. There’s no visual element, in short: each memory is more like a ledger entry than a snapshot. So, there’s nothing out of the ordinary about my having forgotten that particular incident, and it doesn’t necessarily involve any element of repression, though from my mid 30s to my late 50s I believed that it must have done. If there’s a question that needs to be answered, it’s not why I forgot about that incident, but rather why it suddenly popped back into my memory, so many years later.</p><p>What effect did these relatively early experiences have on my ideas and feelings about gender? It seems inevitable that they (the earliest one in particular) must have had some, though even now, having thought about these and related questions frequently over a thirty-five year period, I don’t feel any closer to an answer. I certainly have blind spots when it comes to gender. For example, it’s only quite recently that it’s occurred to me to ask why, as a five-year-old, I was wearing girl’s underwear in the first place? When I eventually remembered that episode, I think I initially just assumed that my mother must have bought underwear in bulk for me and my sisters and doled it out to us indiscriminately. But when I was 5, my youngest sister hadn’t yet been born and the two others were aged 2 and 1 respectively. The oldest I could possibly have been while at that school is 6, at which time my sisters would have been 3 and 2. So, it’s clearly not the case that my mother was buying the same underwear for all of us. Whether deliberately or inadvertently, she bought that “feminine” underwear specifically for me. I’d really like to know why, though even it I had thought of asking my mother during her lifetime, I feel sure that I’d have balked at the prospect. So, I’ll never know definitively, and I can’t resist speculating.</p><p>I intend this to be the first of three posts. In the second, I’m going to examine the concept of <em>gender identity</em>, and in the third I’ll look at <em>gender-as-behaviour</em>.</p>",

			"title": "PDF is preferable to ePub, even on small screens",
			"content_html": "<p>Over a period of months, I’ve been moving <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">my fiction</a> from Medium to this site. Only two pieces have still to be moved: my novel <cite>A Falling Body</cite> and a longish (7,500 word) three-part story that I’m not happy with and that I think needs to be rewritten or abandoned.</p><p>I originally wrote <cite>A Falling Body</cite> in eight chapters averaging 9,000 words each. For posting to Medium I split each chapter into four (or in one case six) smaller parts. So, the Medium version consists of 37 individual HTML pages. I’ve decided to reintegrate the chapters to post them here in nine parts (eight chapters plus three short appendices).</p><p>Looking at the vanity metrics on Medium, I notice that the first part of <cite>A Falling Body</cite> is still getting page views and reads, but these fall off precipitously after three or four parts. Some of the later parts of the story have had no views at all, and none has more than a handful. Much the same is true of the other stories that I’ve posted in multiple parts: <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction/Stockholm-part-1.html\"><cite>Dear Old Stockholm</cite></a>, a 21,000-word novella in six parts; and “<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction/protected-part-1.html\">Protected</a>”, a 9,500-word long short story (or <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/b20dc5452b23\">novelette</a>) in five.</p><p>Because of this rapid fall-off in views, I’ve been thinking that I should, at the end of each part, offer readers the option of downloading the whole story as a PDF. I have in the past been <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/9d3fac7aae42\">dismissive of ebooks</a> and I’ve no intention of <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/ebooks-could-be-real-books.html\">recanting my criticism</a>. It does strike me, though, that PDFs avoid at least some of the disadvantages of ePub (and the related Kindle formats). If the ePub imitates the printed book in arbitrary, unconvincing and often unnecessary ways, the PDF is at least a closer approximation, though of course it too fails to replicate the physical characteristics of print.</p><p>In other words, I think the conventional wisdom may be wrong about the relative merits of ePub and PDF in the online dissemination of long form writing. As I understand it, the prevailing view is that ePubs are preferable because of their flexibility. The text will reflow to fit the viewport, making it possible for someone to read the same document on any arbitrarily sized screen, from tiny phone to enormous desktop monitor. The reader can choose the font size and (within fairly tight limits) face, easily search the text and add bookmarks and annotations.</p><p>What I think this argument gets wrong is that, while the sizes and proportions of the screens may vary widely, most people are going to want to view the text in a window that doesn’t diverge hugely from the dimensions of a typical book. Phones are bigger than they used to be, so I think it’s safe to assume that almost nobody will be reading on a screen smaller than 5&quot;. I calculated that a screen which is 5&quot; diagonally will be 2.8&quot; in width and 3.78&quot; in height, and used that as my starting point. Having tried out several possibilities, I eventually settled on 4&quot; &times; 6&quot;, with a font size of 10pt and quarter-inch (18pt) margins. I could read <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/protected.pdf\">the resulting PDF</a> on the 4&quot; screen of an iPod touch, albeit in landscape mode.</p><p>I opened the same PDF on an iPad and a two notebooks (one Mac, one Windows). They all zoomed in, so that the text appeared quite large, but it wasn’t outrageously so. I think I’ve found my optimal page size.</p><p>HTML is still my preferred format, even for long texts, but I accept that some readers would prefer an offline-readable version of the text, contained in a single document. For these purposes, I’ve concluded that PDF is a less unsatisfactory format than ePub. Besides, it gives me an excuse to play with the <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/designing-for-print-with-css/\">Paged Media module</a> of CSS.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>About 2½ years ago, I sat in a psychotherapist’s office and she asked me what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I had no idea. I made an effort to come up with an answer but it didn’t sound convincing to either of us. The therapist either decided that it would be a waste of time to try to get anything more out of me, or felt she had already planted the seed of further reflection that would bear fruit much later. Either way, she quickly moved on.</p><p>At the time, I was almost 60, and I found laughable the notion that it might be worth a person’s while actively to seek fulfilment in life. If occasionally a life turned out to be in some sense fulfilling, that was invariably the unplanned result of chance. There seemed no point in pursuing a purpose or goal in life when one’s own efforts could have no perceptible effect on the results. For most of its duration, my life had been aimless. That didn’t seem particularly regrettable. It was just normal.</p><p>There’s a song by Joe Jackson that goes “<a href=\"https://songwhip.com/joe-jackson/you-cant-get-what-you-want-till-you-know-what-you-want\">You can’t get what you want till you know what you want</a>”. I always used to sing “You can’t get what you want <em>if</em> you know what you want”. Not because I’d misheard the words — I knew exactly what they were meant to be — but because I thought my version was closer to the truth.</p><p>When I was seeing the psychotherapist I didn’t yet know that I have aphantasia. I had read Blake Ross’s post on the subject some time before and felt a momentary flash of recognition. I made a note of the URL, intending to go back later and digest his credulity-straining assertion that a majority of people can actually <em>see</em> things — like, inside their heads! It wasn’t till two years later that I rediscovered the URL, and this time the sense of recognition stuck.</p><p>In the months after I accepted that I have aphantasia, I began to think that my lifelong aimlessness might in part result from my incapacity for visualization. Though I haven’t been diagnosed with SDAM (severely deficient autobiographical memory), <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2db66c17c5f3\">I’m not in any real doubt that I have that condition</a> (which sometimes accompanies aphantasia). My memories are not graphic or vivid: they’re more in the nature of ideas, abstractions, concepts and narratives than of images; it’s a bit like having index cards or ledger entries instead of detailed descriptions.</p><details><summary>Note: SDAM and aphantasia</summary>There’s a very informative paper by Nicholas Wynn Watkins, titled “(A)phantasia and Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory: Scientific and Personal Perspectives”, freely available for <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Nicholas+Wynn+Watkins%22+SDAM+aphantasia\">download in PDF from various websites</a>.</details><p>My mental conception of the past is dull, unexciting, featureless and full of gaps. Eventually it dawned on me that this is equally true of my conception of the future. After all, there’s no reason why my prospective imagination should be any clearer or sharper than my retrospective one. I don’t “remember” the future any better than I do what has already happened. If most people have at least some vivid, replayable “episodic” memories, isn’t it reasonable to suppose that they view the future in an analogous way? That they can actually “picture” themselves, attending <em>that</em> college, going on holiday to <em>that</em> exotic location, searching for a new job, buying and living in <em>that</em> house? Of course, I’m not suggesting that these imagined glimpses of the future are accurate. I don’t kid myself that most visualizers have a precognitive faculty. What I <em>am</em> suggesting is that these pictures of an imagined future, however misleading they eventually turn out to be, can constitute a target and roadmap that remain stable and consistent long enough to support a sustained pursuit.</p><p>It seems that consistency and stability are the key. It’s easy enough to decide that I’m going to be a more diligent and conscientious person than I have been, or more open to experience, or any number of other things, but without some kind of visual support I just drift off the path, and usually sooner rather than later.</p><p>The fact is that I can’t really imagine any kind of future. Obviously, I couldn’t expect to imagine it <em>visually</em> but somehow I haven’t been able to imagine it conceptually or in the abstract either, at least not in any way that sticks and makes it a substantial target to aim for. I suspect that, for better or worse, human imagination is disproportionately dependent on the visual — and that remains true even for some/many of us who don’t have a visual imagination.</p><p>Anyway, the therapist’s question prompted some kind of self-examination on my part, not immediately, but more than a year later, after I’d had time to think through some of the implications of having aphantasia. And guess what? To my surprise, I <em>do</em> know what I want to do with my life. I want to write, and to get some kind of recognition for my writing. That now seems so obvious that I have trouble grasping the fact that I’ve gone for years — indeed decades — without recognizing it. Writing has always been the thing I’m best (and, I often think, the <em>only</em> thing that I’m really good) at. Sometimes, it has seemed that I’m prepared to go to excessive lengths to avoid admitting that.</p><p>Coming to this realization, however late, shows me that it’s not necessary to be able to <em>imagine things visually</em> in order to find a purpose in life, though the lack of a visual imagination may lead one to “look” in the wrong places. In other words, I’m not <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/82efe3df7fb3\">blaming</a> aphantasia or SDAM for the belatedness of my discovery. I’m very happy to know <em>now</em> what it is that I’m aiming for. I’m simply saying that a visual imagination, if I’d had one, would probably have made it harder to miss the path. On the other hand, it was never inevitable that in the absence of a visual imagination I would take so long to find my way, any more than it was for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47830256\">people like Ed Catmull</a>. That’s just the way it turned out.</p><p>The curious thing is that, while I expect this discovery to make me feel significantly better about myself and my life, I <em>don’t</em> think it’s going to make a lot of difference to my behaviour. I <em>have</em> been writing, on and off, for about 30 years. That includes some unsuccessful attempts at drama, several college essays that I was quite pleased with (but <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/finite-though-unbounded\">only one of which survives</a>), my <a href=\"https://repository.royalholloway.ac.uk/items/25031702-dea3-49c6-a9e6-c068852e5df4/1/\">doctoral thesis</a>, a handful of journal articles on the subject of Andrew Marvell, a <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/744ee7ac0d08\">self-published novel</a>, several <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">short stories</a> and a miscellany of posts over the past three years, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@artkavanagh\">first on Medium</a> and more recently on this site. The difference, if any, is that I’ll now give this activity priority and try to make it my central activity. Ideally, I’ll go about i a bit more purposefully. It also means that I’ll try to write more <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss\">critical book discussion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">fiction</a>, and less about such topics as tech, <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Google-future-search.html\">search</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/362c76c295d0\">publishing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/web-good-old-days.html\">the future of the web</a>. I <em>do</em> have one more tech/publishing piece to write (on the relative merits of ePub and PDF as a format for books), but it will be short.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>Towards the end of 2018, I finally did something I’d been thinking about, on and off, for 20 years: I registered an .ie (Irish) domain name. Throughout 2017 and most of 2018, I had been posting most of my writing, fiction and non, on Medium. At first I wasn’t sure how I was going to divide my sparse output between my own site and Medium but it eventually settled into a pattern.</p><p>My posts on Medium had tended to fall into one of three general categories. First there was the fiction, mostly short but including one novel-length story and a novella. Then, from April 2018, there was a series of posts on the subject of aphantasia (the lack of a visual imagination, or the inability to form mental images), which I learned in my late 50s that I’ve had all my life). And finally, there was my critical book discussion, in which I took a look in greater depth than a typical review at anything from Nelson DeMille’s mystery <cite>The General’s Daughter</cite> to the poetry of William Empson and Andrew Marvell, by way of Kazuo Ishiguro’s <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite>. I’ve treated each of these three categories slightly differently.</p><p>I’ve now moved most of <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">the fiction</a> to this site. The exceptions are the novel (which I’m in the course of moving now) and a three-part story I’m not sure about and that I may decide to rewrite substantially. The aphantasia posts, in contrast, remain on Medium where they’re still attracting readers. Instead of moving them, I’ve created <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html\">a page on this site which lists them all</a>, and to which each of them links back. As for <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss\">the book discussion</a>, I’ve left most of the posts that were originally on Medium where they are, and put the more recent ones here.</p><p>That leaves those posts on Medium that don’t fit into any of these three categories.

			"title": "Heather Sellers: Learning the lessons of face-blindness and place-blindness",
			"content_html": "<p>Last week, I found this extraordinary <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/09/24/where-am-i/\"> true story by Heather Sellers on Longreads</a>. Sellers is a writer and professor of creative writing who suffers from both prosopagnosia (sometimes called face-blindness) and topographical agnosia, which she describes as “a severe disability when it comes to spatial relationships and perceiving direction”. She gets lost, even in very familiar places, is unable to follow directions and often doesn’t know where she is or how to get where she’s going. She writes very well, and her account fascinated me. As I read it, though, I felt an apparently contradictory combination of emotions. “How strange, and impossible to imagine,” I thought, and at the same time “how recognizably familiar”. On the one hand, I couldn’t grasp how it she couldn’t see a pair of red doors straight ahead of her; on the other, I had been in situations curiously analogous to, if <em>much</em> less serious than, those recounted by Sellers.</p><p>I don’t suffer from prosopagnosia: I can distinguish between faces and tell what features of one are unlike those of another. What I <em>can’t</em> do, though, is retain a visual memory of any individual’s face, and call it up when I need to. It occasionally happens, therefore, that I fail to recognize a person (<a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2db66c17c5f3\">including myself in photographs</a>) if I see them out of context. I know that a lot of people have this problem, so I’m not claiming that there’s anything out of the ordinary about my own experience, still less that it’s comparable to the severe difficulties faced by Sellers. It can be embarrassing, of course, but I know that I’m often perceived as a head-in-the-clouds daydreamer, so I can pass my blankness off as inattention.</p><p>As a child, I read that someone had “a good sense of direction” and, with misplaced assurance, assumed that I was the same. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, it wasn’t till I was 52 that I finally acknowledged that this was a fantasy. Apart from London (inevitably), I’ve been lost in Marseille, Nice, Toulouse (more than once), Bordeaux, Perugia and Barcelona. In Nice and Toulouse, I cycled around in circles for hours, failing to find a particular route out of the city. In Toulouse, I eventually gave up and put my bike on the train. In Nice, I had to phone my sister, who was staying in nearby Cagnes, and ask her to come and find me. In Marseille, I was using a map which was rotated anticlockwise through 45°, so that North was to the left, East at the top etc. I thought a simple mental adjustment would see me right, but I kept finding myself pedaling East when I meant to go North and South when I wanted to go East. I had relied on paper maps in the other places too. (These incidents happened before I had a smartphone or a data plan, but I don’t think it would have made much difference.)</p><p>What I didn’t realize until years later is that I was incapable of visually memorizing the relevant part of the map, so I’d try to convert it mentally into a series of narrative directions but I’d invariably miss something important. The map was useful to me only as long as I was looking directly at it. Once it went back in my pannier I might as well have left it at home. In Perugia and Barcelona I was on foot rather than on the bike, so I could pull the map out as often as I needed to. That didn’t seem to help much.</p><p>Though my difficulties with remembering faces, maps and directions don’t cause me problems anywhere near as severe as those encountered by Heather Sellers, I found her account of her condition, and particularly the method she uses to deal with it, useful as well as interesting. Many of her students have disabilities related to learning or mental health difficulties. She has to complete forms for each one, including checking boxes to indicate that she understands what accommodations they need in order to complete her course. It struck her that she needed to understand and make allowances for her own special requirements just as she did for those of her students. She actually printed out a set of the forms used by Students with Disabilities Services, and completed it for herself:</p><blockquote>Heather needs more time to plan her route to both new and familiar places.</blockquote><blockquote>Heather needs someone to help her when she is lost. She may not be able to explain why she is lost. Do you understand? She doesn’t need to explain.</blockquote><p>Instead of berating herself (as had been her habit) for her inability to accomplish an ostensibly simple task like finding her way around Tampa airport, she began to make allowances for her disability — to permit herself the same kind of “accommodations” she would make for one of her students. There’s a lesson to be learned from her experience.</p><p>If you find that your child, your student, your employee, your friend <em>or yourself</em> seems inexplicably to have unexpected problems doing things that don’t seem all that difficult, try being patient and kind with them. My own late discovery that my <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html\">lack of a visual imagination</a> is not shared by a majority of the population taught me that it’s easy, indeed natural, to assume that we all see and relate to the world the same way. That’s a dangerous assumption that we need to be wary of.</p>",

It’s <cite>Tempus Fugit</cite> by <a href=\"https://shop.chickcorea.com/products/chick-corea-vigilette-tempus-fugit\">Chick Corea’s Vigilette trio</a> and I’ve wanted to listen to it since I first heard about it nearly 2 years ago. The drummer in the trio is Marcus Gilmore, whose playing I know from his work with Vijay Iyer. (As well as having their albums, I saw Iyer’s trio live in Toulouse in about 2010.) Marcus Gilmore is the grandson of Roy Haynes, who played drums on some of Corea’s best trio recordings, notably <cite>Now He Sings, Now He Sobs</cite> and <cite>Trio Music: Live in Europe</cite>.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1722/0245/products/Vigilette_Tempus_Fugit_Cover_1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Vigilette, Tempus Fugit album cover\" height=\"640\" width=\"640\" ><p>I ordered <cite>Tempus Fugit</cite> in CD format because that’s the only way I could get it. It’s not on any of the streaming or download sites and can be obtained only from Corea’s website or at one of his concerts. Postage (shipping, if you prefer) from the United States is $14, bringing the total cost of the disc to $34, more than I’ve paid for a single album in at least 10 years. I hesitated to order it at that price without having heard it first. While I like Corea’s music in general, it’s very varied and I certainly don’t enjoy all of it to the same degree. Then I found <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/31/662519569/chick-corea-back-in-boston\">a recording of Vigilette playing live in Boston</a> and that clinched it: I ordered the album. (I had previously searched NPR.org for “Vigilette” and “Chick Corea” and got no relevant hits.)</p><p>Up to 2017, I had preferred to buy music on CD. I would download something from iTunes if the CD was hard to get hold of (an import, or out of print) or exorbitantly priced, but I’d always buy the CD where it was practical to do so, particularly if it came in a Digipak-type cover. (Jewel cases weren’t nearly so appealing: they were cheap-looking, easily cracked and took up too much space, being more than twice the width a CD cover needed to be.) Then, three years ago, it struck me that it was no longer practical to keep accumulating CDs. They were bulky to store, I hadn’t owned an audio CD player for years, and ripping them was a time-consuming chore.</p><p>Though they were introduced in the early 80s, I didn’t hear a CD being played until 1986 and bought my first one only in 1989. I quickly became enthusiastic about the format. My ex-wife used to say that I could scratch a vinyl record just by looking at it, and she was exaggerating only slightly. CDs saved me from the effects of my own clumsiness. Partly for this reason, I’ve never been tempted to join the vinyl revival. I <em>have</em>, on the other hand, sometimes considered reverting from downloads to CDs.</p><p>This is not because I have any aesthetic attachment to the format itself. A CD is nothing more than a cheap, plastic disc on which digital files are stored. It’s no more appealing than any other storage medium, such as a USB thumb drive or an external hard disk. My nostalgia for CDs is based on two factors: (a) they come in physical covers which usually contain liner notes and (b) if you rip them you have full control over the metadata you attach to the track.</p><p>If you buy a digital download from certain publishers, it’s likely that it will be accompanied by a “digital booklet” consisting of a pdf file. This is a poor substitute for its printed counterpart and, if you’re not careful, will end up occupying some of the limited and precious place on your music player/phone. Years ago, I used to argue that, whenever you buy an album as a digital download, you should have the option of getting a copy of the liner notes or Digipak mailed to you. Apart from anything else, it could function as a physical reminder that you bought an album which might otherwise languish overlooked on a hard drive or in flash memory. I still think the music publishing companies should consider this approach as a way of making sales (downloads) more attractive than a subscription model.</p><p>But the thing I most dislike about downloads and streaming alike is the poor quality of the metadata, the information attached to each track such as artist, album artist, song and album titles, publication date, composer name and so on. This is typically inconsistent from one album to another and is often just plain wrong. One of my biggest bugbears is that, in the case of a live album, you will almost invariably find some variation of “(Live)” or “- Live” appended to the song titles, even though it should be obvious to the most inattentive record company intern that “(Live)” is not actually part of the title. The worst example of this phenomenon I’ve yet found is an(excellent) album by Charlie Haden and Brad Mehldau, where every song title ends “(Live at Enjoy Jazz Festival, Christuskirche, Mannheim / Nov. 5, 2007)”. The parenthetical note is longer than the actual song title in each case.</p><img src=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Haden_Mehldau.jpg\" alt=\"iTunes view of the album Long Ago and Far Away, by Charlie Haden and Brad Mehldau\" height=\"670\" width=\"640\" ><p>Different authors of metadata have differing views on whether “Year” should be the year of first publication, year of recording, or year of the current rerelease. (For what it’s worth, I prefer the first of these.) Where it’s an instrumental performance (I listen to a lot of jazz piano versions of standards), should the lyricist be credited as well as the composer — “Washington/Young” or “Victor Young”; “Kosma/Prévert”, “Kosma/Mercer” or “Joseph Kosma”? (There are arguments both ways but I’d like consistency, where possible.)</p><p>Of course I could amend the metadata on a digital download but it’s a tedious process (made worse by the fact that I don’t have a Mac at the moment, so have to use iTunes on Windows). Worse, whenever you get a new device (or possibly reset/reformat an old one) you risk downloading your purchases again, with the original, defective metadata. It’s easier (though still tedious) to rip the CD and add the metadata from scratch — and, up to three years ago, that’s what I generally did.</p><p>It’s for this reason that I periodically find myself thinking that maybe I should go back to buying CDs and avoid digital downloads (except where the CD is hard to find or too expensive). Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s practical. I already have too many CDs and nowhere permanent to store them. Six months ago, I had to move out of where I was living and I resolved to give away all the CDs that I could bear to part with, including all those in jewel cases. In the end, I managed to divest myself of only a handful.</p><p>It seems there isn’t a completely satisfactory answer to the conundrum. So, for now, I’m going to continue to buy my music from iTunes and manually amend the metadata, when I get around to it, swearing furiously as I go.</p>",

			"title": "In defence of flow: a response to Barbara Gail Montero",
			"content_html": "<p>In her essay “<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/the-true-expert-does-not-perform-in-a-state-of-effortless-flow\">Against Flow</a>”, Barbara Gail Montero attacks the idea that “flow” can enable the true virtuoso to transcend difficulty, struggle and self-doubt, and to perform with effortless excellence. She writes:</p><blockquote>Flow sounds appealing, and it seems to frequently coincide with some of our most pleasurable pinnacles of human experience, but it doesn’t necessarily translate into optimal performance.</blockquote><p>Notwithstanding the essay’s pithy title, it quickly becomes clear that Professor Montero is arguing, not against flow itself, but against what she sees as the prevalent idea that in fields such as ballet, concert performance and philosophy, expert practitioners can rely on flow rather than on work, physical effort, conscious thought and reflective self-analysis to achieve excellence.</p><p>To my mind, this seems to arise from a misunderstanding of what flow is, and what its uses might be. As I have understood it, flow is not a means or a method of achieving mastery or excellence, but rather the occasional, undependable and elusive <em>reward</em> for having achieved them. It is, first and foremost, <em>rare</em>, and it cannot be relied on to show up on any particular occasion. So, a concert pianist who trusted to flow to stand in for the hard work of deliberate practice, directed effort and self-awareness would be taking an unacceptable, indeed insane, risk. My suspicion is that flow happens when the deliberation, the self-examination and the physical effort become so integrated into a performance that they look and feel like second nature, as if the performer doesn’t have to think or observe or execute a difficult physical action, while the thought, the observation and the execution nevertheless have to occur.</p><p>Flow, then, is an end rather than the means. As <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/stealing-fire-review.html\">Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal put it</a>, flow is a sense of ekstasis, of being beside oneself, an altered state of consciousness. It is true that some of the groups and individuals that they write about in <cite>Stealing Fire</cite> (the Navy Seals, for example) are trying to find a way to control flow, to summon it at will, but of course that’s not to say that they think it can be used as a substitute for gruelling training. If they can control the flow, that <em>may</em> make their performance better in some areas, but I doubt if anyone thinks that their training will become any less demanding on that account.</p> <p>The misunderstanding that I referred to above is not Montero’s own. She sees very clearly that flow-as-end is a much more useful idea than flow-as-means:</p><blockquote>Csikszentmihalyi’s research suggests that flow is conducive to optimal <em>experience</em>. But it doesn’t tell us anything about whether it is conducive to optimal <em>performance</em>. So look for flow when you want to <em>feel</em> better, but not necessarily when you want to <em>do</em> better.</blockquote><p>This is unobjectionable as far as it goes, but it leaves out of account the possibility that flow, while appearing only rarely, may well improve performance, when it <em>is</em> present. It is plausible that the undistracted mind may think, observe, reflect and exercise control more effectively, even when it feels like it’s doing these things “unconsciously”. And, even when flow isn’t present, its <em>prospect</em> may provide the motivation of the performer to work harder, do better.</p><p>Montero is concerned that the pursuit of flow  may distract us from rather than assist our pursuit of excellence:</p><blockquote>… if developing one’s potential is key to a meaningful life – developing what Immanuel Kant speaks of in the <cite>Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals</cite> as our duty to cultivate our ‘predispositions to greater perfection’ – then flow, while bringing momentary happiness, might impede the attainment of that loftier value.</blockquote><p>If it is indeed the case that the cultivation of our “predispositions to greater perfection” is what gives life its meaning, it is nevertheless far from obvious that there is a clear, discoverable path of development or cultivation, to be followed by the would-be virtuoso without deviation or distraction; or that the attempt to achieve ekstasis will necessarily lead us away from that path.</p><p>While it seems to me that Montero overstates her case, I have to admit that her prescription of fully conscious striving over a prolonged period is unlikely to be damaging, except to the extent that it may discourage inexperienced people from trying to fulfill their potential. Kotler and Wheal (and the Navy Seals) notwithstanding, I remain sceptical of the notion that the active pursuit of flow or ekstasis will be found rewarding. When flow comes, it does so unannounced, and having been hoped for rather than confidently expected. In the meantime, why not play through that exercise again?</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>I argued in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advertising-future-surveillance-capitalism-art-kavanagh/\">Advertising and the future of surveillance capitalism</a> that Google and Facebook are in a rather paradoxical position. They’re both dependent on online advertising, a source of revenue which seems at once precarious and stable. It’s stable because it’s a well established model which is supported a lot of vested interests (such as advertising departments) and it’s precarious because, as <a href=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising/13228924500-22d5fd24\">Jesse Frederik and Maurits Martijn have shown in an enlightening article</a> in <cite>The Correspondent</cite>, online advertising is a kind of “bubble” that must be expected to burst sooner or later. And, as is often the case, “sooner or later” probably means “sooner than we expect”. What will the web look like, if and when Google and Facebook find that the advertising budgets of the world’s major companies are no longer flowing without obstruction directly into their bank accounts?</p><p>Frankly, I don’t know. I’m not a futurologist and my previous attempts at prediction have tended to be ignominiously wrong. But I’d like to suggest that, in trying to imagine where the web is going, we need to take a much longer view than we’re often inclined or accustomed to do.</p><p>How long do you expect the web to last? If you’re anything like me, your answer flickers rapidly between “thousands of years” and “it’s already at death’s door, though there’s an outside chance that we can revive it”. Even if we believe that the second possibility is the more likely, it makes sense to behave as if the first were true, because it might well be. But if the web really does have a long future ahead of it, it follows that it’s barely out of its infancy. Almost nobody I know has been using it for longer than 25 years. (I first accessed it in late 1997, just 22 years ago.) Notwithstanding the great changes that have come about since then, it would be fanciful to describe the web as “mature”. <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/Google-future-search.html\">As I complained recently</a>, we don’t even have a robust, reliable way to <strong>search</strong> the web, relying instead on heuristics and algorithms whose workings are (to say the least) opaque.</p><p>It might be worthwhile, rather than spend a lot of intellectual effort and energy attempting to foresee the shape and details of a postfacebook web, simply to remind ourselves regularly that a postfacebook web <em>will</em> come to pass, and (in relative terms) very soon.</p><p>A few short years ago, it was being widely assumed that Facebook had irrevocably and permanently supplanted the open web and that Twitter had taken over the role formerly filled by your RSS feed reader. After a number of scandals like Cambridge Analytica and Russiagate, we’ve come to see that the grip of these “social” networks on our online lives is not as secure as we so recently thought, and have turned our attention to divining what is to replace them. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/30/opinion/social-media-future.html\">recent opinion piece by Annalee Newitz</a> in the <cite>New York Times</cite> begins:</p><blockquote>Social media is broken … Though we talk about reforming and regulating it, “fixing” it, those of us who grew up on the internet know there’s no such thing as a social network that lasts forever. Facebook and Twitter are slowly imploding. And before they’re finally dead, we need to think about what the future will be like after social media so we can prepare for what comes next.</blockquote><p>One assumption that underpins this quest for the next biggish thing is the conviction that there’s <strong>no going back</strong>. Blogs and RSS feeds were significant in the 2000s. They’ve had their time in the sun and now it’s the turn of something else. If you find yourself sympathetic to this point of view, consider the current revival in popularity of the email newsletter.</p><p>If, on the other hand, we take the kind of long view I’m proposing, instead of seeing Facebook and surveillance capitalism as the culmination of the internet’s short history, we can view them instead as an early experiment that is in the course of failing (or at least of having its parameters changed). From this point of view, it’s easier to see the web of the 2000s, not as a developmental stage that has now been surpassed, but rather as a set of possibilities which still have plenty of potential to be realized. Maybe it’s possible to go back after all.</p><p>One of the things Anil Dash would like to go back to is the widespread use of the hyperlink: “<a href=\"https://anildash.com/2019/12/10/link-in-bio-is-how-they-tried-to-kill-the-web/\">‘Link in bio’ is a slow knife</a>”. The link, after all, is the feature that put the “hyper” into hypertext: it’s precisely what was meant to be <strong>weblike</strong> about the web. And it’s been clear for some time that the link has been on the wane. Facebook and Twitter effectively permit only one link per post; and Dash makes much of the fact that in Instagram you get just one link per account! One of the things that used to frustrate me about Google+ was that, while it was possible for a post to include multiple links, all but the last one (the one with the link preview) had to be bare URLs. It wasn’t possible to use a HTML-style &lt;a href=\"<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a</a>\"&gt;<strong>anchor tag</strong>&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>On Goodreads, where anchor tags <em>are</em> allowed, it seems that a lot of people don’t use them, but instead just paste the bare URL into their review or comment. I’ve often wondered if this is because people are more likely to trust links if they can see the target address there in the text, without having to hover the pointer over the link to reveal where it’s leading. What hadn’t really occurred to me before I read Dash’s piece is that the social media pursue a strategy of making links scarce, as a way of keeping people on their site or in their app.</p><p>So, it’s not simply the case that people avoid links because they don’t trust them. On the contrary, Dash insists, “people <em>like</em> links”. I hope he’s right. If he is, there’s a good chance that the web that comes after the reign of Facebook will be recognizably the offspring of the web that preceded it. We may yet live to see the web grow up.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>Have you heard of Mix? It’s a web discovery engine founded by Garrett Camp about two years ago as a new, improved replacement for StumbleUpon. I’ve been <a href=\"https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/getting-the-mix-just-right-f161fd9af9f6\">using it fairly consistently since February 2018</a> but I think that experiment may have come to an end. Earlier this week I deactivated my account.</p><p>I’d been thinking about doing so for several months, for two reasons. First (from the point of view of the person looking for something to read), the combination of algorithmic recommendation and human curation doesn’t seem to produce results significantly better than Facebook’s unassisted algorithms. As <a href=\"https://medium.com/@artkavanagh/eluding-the-algorithm-5fd3d457923c\">I wrote in May 2019</a>:</p><blockquote>Mix is coming to resemble a typical news feed on social media.</blockquote><p>The other reason (from the point of view of the writer/publisher looking for readers) is that, as with its “parent”, StumbleUpon, traffic referred by Mix tends to have a high <strong>bounce</strong> rate. I first noticed this earlier this year when I learned that the iPad app was loading the target page into an iframe without any kind of preview, so that people using the app were visiting the page before they’d had a chance to decide whether they were interested or not. In many cases they would immediately swipe on to the next recommended page. In the case of Medium posts, this led to an inflated number of page views accompanied by a rapidly falling read ratio. Because of this, <a href=\"https://artkavanagh.micro.blog/2019/04/27/is-garret-camps.html\">I became much more wary about <strong>mixing</strong> my own posts</a>, particularly if those posts were on Medium.</p><p>I was no longer using Mix to discover new things to read, but only to share links to my own and other people’s writing. Since I wasn’t sharing my Medium posts and had no reason to think that other posts (mine or anybody else’s) had much to gain from page views coming from Mix, there didn’t seem to be any good reason to continue to post there. The only thing that made me hesitate before deactivating was the relatively high number of followers I had on the platform.</p><p>At 7,600, this was many times the combined total of followers I’d ever managed to accumulate on all other social media and similar platforms. The higher figure on Mix is no mystery: I had been a relatively early adopter and the curators had taken a liking to one of my collections, “Writers on writing”, so I was one of the people recommended to new sign-ups. Although I’m in the habit saying “<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/following.html\">Followers don’t count</a>”, was I really going to abandon an account that had 7,600 of them?</p><p>I procrastinated for several months but, in the end, it looks as if I am. There’s not much benefit in having a largish number of followers if I only occasionally share links to my own writing. But the immediate trigger for deactivating the account was that I noticed last week that Mix is no longer allowing comments. This was probably inevitable as the comments had become, to a large extent, a vehicle for spam. However, I find that I’m not very interested in using a platform that merely allows me to share links without adding any additional commentary. Where’s the “engagement” in that?</p><p>It seems that, while Mix allows me to deactivate my account, there’s no way to delete it outright. I <em>could</em> reactivate it at any time. But I don’t think I’ll be doing that.</p>",
