			"content_html": "<p>A week ago I posted <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/short-stories-online.html\">a list of short stories that can be read online</a>. The list had its origin as Mix collection that is presumably no longer accessible because I’ve deactivated my Mix account. One of my other collections on Mix — the one that Mix itself recommended to new sign-ups — was “Writers on writing”. As that collection, too, has — or ought to have — disappeared with my account, I’ve extracted from it the links that seemed to me to be most worth keeping. Here they are:</p><p><a href=\"https://electricliterature.com/elisa-wouk-almino-thinks-novels-are-overrated/\">Elisa Wouk Almino Thinks Novels Are Overrated</a> in <cite>Electric Literature</cite></p> <p><a href=\"https://lithub.com/kevin-barry-on-the-need-to-sustain-our-literature\">Kevin Barry on the need to sustain our literature</a></p><p>Sara Baume, ‘<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/sara-baume-i-was-so-tired-of-my-laptop-i-felt-compelled-to-work-with-my-hands-1.4199677\">I was so tired of my laptop, I felt compelled to work with my hands</a>’</p><blockquote>In comparison to making sculpture, the practice of writing is magnificently compact and easily dispersed. It allowed me to say precisely what I meant in a form understood by everybody. And yet, by the end of book two, I was so tired of my own voice and the things I had said and meant with it. I longed to silently make small objects that were concerned with form, feel and colour; that I could touch, hold and smell; that nobody else saw or cared about.</blockquote><p>Tim Carmody, <a href=\"https://kottke.org/19/03/writing-and-money\">The problem of writing and money</a><br>A thoughtful and realistic response to Sandra Newman’s piece in <cite>Electric Literature</cite> about the poverty of writers</p><p>Naoise Dolan <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/naoise-dolan-my-personal-life-is-nobody-else-s-business-1.4225289\">sees nothing wrong with writers mining their own lives for material</a> but that’s not what she does.

Subplots that would once have been murky to the point of incomprehensibility (what was the deal with that dead sea captain again?) step into the light. Little jokes and echoes, separated by dozens or even hundreds of pages, come rustling out of the text forest.

I previously maintained this list as a collection on <a href=\"https://mix.com/\">Mix</a> and as a board on Pinterest. I’ve deleted my Pinterest account and deactivated my Mix profile, so I thought it would be a good idea to recreate the collection/board as an ordinary web page.</p><p>Unfortunately, the comments I added to each link when I originally posted it have been lost. Mix seems to have done away with comments entirely, deleting the existing ones in the process (presumably because they were being used as a vehicle for spam). I was mistaken in thinking I had exported the Pinterest board as an RSS feed before deleting my account (as I did with some other boards). The feed would have contained my comments and pin descriptions, but unfortunately it doesn’t exist. As a result, many of the entries below are without descriptions or explanations as to why I think they're worth your while. In some cases, I’ve added new descriptions and I may well add more as and when I reread the stories.</p><h2>In alphabetical order by author’s surname</h2><p>Brendan Bakala, “<a href=\"https://www.reflexfiction.com/athru-by-brendan-bakala\">Athrú</a>”<br>The title of this piece of flash fiction is the Irish for “change”. The narrator, Kate, has been back to Ireland for a family occasion and is met at O’Hare airport by her father, who is awkwardly uncomfortable about one change in particular. A lesson in how to talk around a subject without addressing it directly.</p><p>Mary M Burke, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/transatlantic-railroad-a-short-story-by-mary-m-burke-1.3498994\">Transatlantic railroad</a>”<br></p><p>Claire Buss, “<a href=\"https://workingtitleblogspot.wordpress.com/2017/08/20/inspire-o\">Inspire-O</a>”<br>Claire Buss writes science fiction, notably the novel <cite>The Gaia Effect</cite>. In this flash fiction piece, a discovery has made it possible for technology to give “destiny” a helping hand.</p><p>Niamh Campbell, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/an-encounter-a-new-short-story-by-niamh-campbell-1.4305290/\">An encounter</a>”<br>A new short story by Niamh Campbell, whose “Love many” won the 2020 Sunday Times Audible award. A journalist interviewing a poet experiences the anxiety of influence.</p><p>Fiona Cooke, “<a href=\"https://unusualfiction.wordpress.com/2018/03/17/ventry-irish-gothic-fiction-for-st-patricks-day\">Ventry</a>”<br></p><p>Amanda Craig, “<a href=\"https://www.amandacraig.com/short-stories/the-ghost-writer\">The ghost writer</a>”<br></p><p>Iseult Deane, “<a href=\"https://thebohemyth.com/2017/10/24/laces-by-iseult-deane\">Laces</a>”</p><p>Naoise Dolan, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/family-news-a-short-story-by-naoise-dolan-1.4310741/\">Family news</a>”<br>A new short story from the author of the novel <cite>Exciting Times</cite>. It’s told from the point of view of an effectively homeless woman who has moved in with her older sister and neice.</p><p>Deena Drewis, “<a href=\"https://catapult.co/stories/fiction-girls-in-love-short-story-by-deena-drewis\">Girls in love</a>”<br>Three women, now in their late 20s, who have been friends since childhood, meet for brunch to resolve a crisis that one of them is going through. Their reunions are becoming increasingly rare. Why is that?</p><p>Wendy Erskine, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/locksmiths-a-short-story-by-wendy-erskine-1.3281960\">Locksmiths</a>”<br></p><p>Sorcha Fogarty, “<a href=\"https://thebohemyth.com/2017/12/19/the-piano-by-sorcha-fogarty\">The piano</a>”</p><p>Mary Gaitskill, “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/novellas/this-is-pleasure\">This is pleasure</a>”<br>Described as a novella, this 15,000-word story is narrated alternately by Margot and Quin, who have been friends for years. Quin is a senior editor in a publishing house and has believed “he could perceive people’s most essential nature just by looking at them” and that therefore he knew “what they would most respond to”. Unfortunately for him, younger women are less willing to play along with that ego-reinforcing kind of belief than their predecessors appeared to be.</p><p>Mia Gallagher, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/all-bones-a-short-story-by-mia-gallagher-1.3542870\">All bones</a>”</p><p>Sarah Gilmartin, “<a href=\"https://belfastbookfestival.com/download/files/MCA2020%20Short%20Story%20Winner%20Sarah%20GIlmartin.pdf\">The wife</a>”<br>Winner of the 2020 Máirtín Crawford short story award at the Belfast Book Festival. A woman reflects in anger and dismay on how her husband’s behaviour turned their two-star restaurant into “a hostile environment of pervasive sexual misconduct”.</p><p>Alan Glynn, “<a href=\"http://www.alanglynnbooks.com/stories/the-copyist-2\">The copyist</a>”<br>Imagine how different the world would be if John F Kennedy (1917–1963) had murdered John D Rockefeller (1839–1937) — in the 1870s. JFK is sent back in time and replaced in the Oval Office by a “copy”, with results that can’t be what <em>anybody</em> intended.</p><p>Anne Griffin, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/change-given-a-short-story-by-anne-griffin-1.3589944\">Change given</a>”<br></p><p>Lauren Groff, “<a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a20717306/lauren-groff-snake-stories-excerpt-florida-short-story-collection\">Snake stories</a>”<br></p><p>Mark Haddon, “<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/04/pier-falls-new-short-story-mark-haddon\">The pier falls</a>”<br>This realistic, documentary (yet fictional) account of the collapse of Brighton pier in July 1970 is a frighteningly believable description of a disaster that, for all we know, might easily have happened.</p><p>Sophie Hannah, “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/20/the-tennis-church-sophie-hannah-short-story\">The tennis church</a>”<br>A Christmas short story featuring the characters from Hannah’s series of detective novels, Charlie Zailer and Simon Woodhouse. A childhood friend of Charlie’s seems to be missing, but insists that she hasn’t disappeared.</p><p>Kait Heacock, “<a href=\"http://www.vol1brooklyn.com/2013/04/14/sunday-stories-upstairs\">Upstairs</a>”</p><p>Dearbhaile Houston, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/viscera-a-new-short-story-by-dearbhaile-houston-1.4306067\">Viscera</a>”<br>Dearbhaile Houston is working on a collection of short stories. In this one a woman dissects an unsatisfactory relationship and examines its entrails, before it has officially died.</p><p>Rosemary Jenkinson, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-lost-generation-a-short-story-by-rosemary-jenkinson-1.4271992/\">The lost generation</a>”<br>From Jenkinson’s collection <cite>Lifestyle choice 10mg</cite>, the story of a school reunion after 25 years.</p><p>Kate Jones, “<a href=\"https://www.reflexfiction.com/jellyfish-by-kate-jones\">Jellyfish</a>”</p><p>P Kearney Byrne, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/two-damsons-a-short-story-by-p-kearney-byrne-1.3564048\">Two damsons</a>”<br>Two women celebrate the award of funding for an antisuicide centre in a small town near Carrick-on-Shannon. But there isn’t a lot you can do to celebrate in a town like that other than drink. “Drunk and horny sort of went together for me”, says Grace, the narrator.</p><p>John Lanchester, “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/signal-john-lanchester\">Signal</a>”<br>The narrator worries that one of the other guests spending New Year’s Eve at a country estate in Yorkshire, a very tall, cold (and rude) man, is taking a dangerous interest in his children. The tall man wanders around restlessly, speaking to nobody except the children, looking all the time at his phone. The host (the narrator’s friend from Cambridge, now stupendously rich) claims not to know who the tall man is, or even to have seen him. What does this mysterious figure want?</p><p>Clarice Lispector, “<a href=\"https://lithub.com/clarice-lispector-a-woman-knows-to-say-no\">A woman knows to say no</a>”<br></p><p>Jane McDermott, “<a href=\"https://www.reflexfiction.com/the-burden-of-proof-by-jane-mcdermott\">The burden of proof</a>”</p><p>Jon McGregor, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/martin-s-story-by-jon-mcgregor-1.3336178\">Martin’s story</a>”</p><p>Barry McKinley, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/my-story-about-a-gay-refugee-in-ireland-is-on-kenya-s-school-syllabus-but-now-he-s-straight-1.3455486\">Almost home</a>”<br></p><p>Sophie Mackintosh, “<a href=\"http://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/self-improvement\">Self-improvement</a>”<br></p><p>Ottessa Moshfegh, “<a href=\"http://www.barcelonareview.com/92/e_om.html\">The surrogate</a>”<br>A 28-year-old woman with a model’s looks takes on the role of titular vice president of a business she doesn’t understand. She is the front woman for an enterprise owned and run by Lao Ting, who believes that his American customers would be happier to deal with a young, blue-eyed, Christie Brinkley lookalike than with him. Lao Ting appears to be a conman, but the narrator’s real problems lie somewhere else entirely.</p><p>Louise Nealon, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/you-ve-read-cat-person-now-read-this-irish-bad-sex-short-story-1.3363992\">What feminism is</a>”<br>This story won the Seán Ó Faoláin competition in 2017. A young woman, a student and writer, feels competitive with other young women, also writers, who (like her) have had sex with the male coeditor of a college literary magazine. The <cite>Irish Times</cite> headline on the story is “You've read Cat Person, now read this Irish bad-sex short story”but the comparison could lead readers to expect the wrong things from this story. There are superficial similarities, of course — male sex partner behaving badly, for a start.</p><p>Alissa Nutting, “<a href=\"https://lithub.com/models-assistant\">Model’s assistant</a>”<br>A woman, in her 30s but still “always the nerd at the party”, drifts into the unpaid but lucrative role of model’s assistant when the model, who is “from somewhere Swedishy” but almost certainly not Sweden, hands her a crystal-encrusted phone and, four days later, calls her on it. From Nutting’s collection <cite>Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls</cite>.</p><p>Frank O’Connor, “<a href=\"http://www.cyc-net.org/cyc-online/cycol-0201-oconnor.html\">My Oedipus complex</a>”</p><p>Nuala O’Connor, “<a href=\"http://newflashfiction.com/nuala-oconnor\">Birdie</a>”</p><p>Roisín O’Donnell, “<a href=\"https://www.writing.ie/special-guests/how-to-build-a-space-rocket-writing-ie-short-story-of-the-year-2018\">How to build a space rocket</a>”<br>It was only when I was putting this list into alphabetical order that I noticed that O’Donnell seems to have a liking for “How to …” titles. This story is told from the point of view of seven-year-old Keshika, finding it difficult to interpret the behaviour of her parents (who are about to “take a break” from each other) while trying to make a rocket with red phosphorous matches and aluminium foil.</p><p>Roisín O’Donnell, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/how-to-learn-irish-in-seventeen-steps-by-rois%C3%ADn-o-donnell-1.2659288\">How to learn Irish in seventeen steps</a>”<br>A story from O’Donnell’s extraordinary collection <cite>Wild Quiet</cite>. A Brazilian woman marries an Irish musician and follows him when he goes back to Ireland, where she registers as a teacher. Her registration is conditional on her learning the Irish language within three years.</p><p>Helen Oyeyemi, “<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/fiction/2016/03/interesting-about-e-and-new-short-story-helen-oyeyemi\">Interesting about E and A</a>”<br>The friendship between two obscure Brontë scholars comes under strain when one of them receives some minor recognition. The narrator only ever refers to  the slightly more successful scholar as “my best friend”. They speculate about an apparent reference found in a letter, and about the letter’s author, and about the parallels between their own relationship and that between the two youngest Brontë siblings.</p><p>Matthew Di Paoli, “<a href=\"http://neonmagazine.co.uk/quicksand-by-matthew-di-paoli\">Quicksand</a>”</p><p>Karen Perry, “<a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/tell-me-something-about-your-wife-1.3139165\">Tell me something about your wife</a>”</p><p>Edgar Allan Poe, “<a href=\"https://poestories.com/read/facts\">The facts in the case of M.

			"title": "Anxiety after all",
			"content_html": "<p>I <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/unspecific-nostalgia.html\">recently suggested</a> that my habitual “unspecific nostalgia” results from feelings that were originally attached to (or stimulated by) memories that, because of SDAM, I no longer experience vividly. The nostalgic feelings are still there but they become generalized because their particular occasions no longer hold any particular significance for me.</p><p>It’s just occurred to me that something similar is probably happening with my feelings of anxiety. I’ve <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/a2b0b3bc8425\">written before</a> about the fact that it was only in my late 50s, after some sessions with a psychotherapist, that I at last recognized that I have been affected by anxiety all my life. The unexpected and unfamiliar sense of <em>wrongness</em> that I experienced during the year after I came back to Ireland at the end of 2011 was, I now think, in large part unacknowledged anxiety.</p><p>Because of a variety of factors — my age, the post-crash economy, the idiosyncratic nature of such work skills as I had managed to develop, and the fact that I had often in the past found job-search difficult — I believed it was unlikely that I’d be able to get a job and that I was probably about to fall into poverty and maybe homelessness. The prospect terrified me, but I wasn’t able to recognize that this was the case. I remained puzzled while I considered various other possibilities. I suffered wild mood swings.</p><p>When, at least five years later, the therapist pointed out to me that my main problem seemed to be anxiety, I briefly believed that I had found the reason for my inexplicable reaction to being “home” in Ireland after 24 years. A few months after my last session with the therapist, I realized that I have aphantasia, and that seemed to provide more context (and a possible explanation) for my difficulties in handling anxiety. In effect, I thought that <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/511989fa1e71\">my inability to visualize reassuring scenarios and successful outcomes was making it more difficult for me to get past the anxiety</a>. Some friends and family members that I outlined this hypothesis to thought it was unconvincing, to put it mildly.</p><p>But already I was starting to play down the anxiety and play up the aphantasia. In the same post linked to in the previous paragraph, “Aphantasia is not a disability”, I wrote:</p><blockquote>I began to wonder if anxiety isn’t my core problem after all, but just a consequence of my general inability to picture possible futures.</blockquote><p>Soon, I was considering all sorts of aphantasia-related alternatives to anxiety as explanations for my life-problems: an <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/e969c8f9587\">inability to plan, schedule or prioritize</a> because I lack a visual imagination; <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/e81dc7e0e259\">ADHD</a> and/or a difficulty with <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/c7a5cb05162c\">executive function</a> (nonverbal working memory); absence of <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/5f8642ea7c34\">motivation</a> caused by not being able to imagine <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html\">a future worth aiming for</a>; and so on. Any explanation, in short, that would minimize the significance of anxiety.</p><p>It was easy to believe that the problem was something other than anxiety because very often the task at which I was digging in my heels seemed safe and innocuous: there was no objective reason why it should make me uneasy. I’d sit down at the computer to edit a document. It would be a document of a kind I had edited hundreds of times before, with no unusual features and nothing to suggest that it would cause me any unexpected difficulty. Yet, I’d have that horrible sharp, churning feeling in the pit of my stomach, and a sense that I would have to push past an immoveable physical barrier before I could even open the document and start to read it. Or I’d procrastinate for ages before making a perfectly routine, unconfrontational phone call. How could the thing that was stopping me be anxiety, when there was clearly nothing to be anxious about?</p><p>It was only after I wrote about unspecific nostalgia that it occurred to me that I might equally be experiencing <em>unspecific anxiety</em>. In other words, the feelings of anxiety had been caused by particular experiences and episodes that had actually happened to me but that I could no longer remember except in general, almost abstract, terms. The feelings were still real but I couldn’t associate them with particular (episodic) memories. If this is true, it makes sense that I should be more susceptible to these feelings while I’m in Ireland.</p><p>When I lived in Ireland in the 1980s, there was plenty for me to be anxious about, much of it economic. I don’t want to go into details, partly because SDAM would make it difficult for me to remember them and partly, of course, because even if I could remember them the process would be painful. But, as with the feelings of nostalgia discussed in my previous post, I now think it likely that I became anxious because of specific occurrences, situations and interactions, and that the anxious feelings have survived my memories of the events that gave rise to them. As with the unspecific nostalgia, the anxiety has become generalized, and associated with Ireland/Dublin as a whole, instead of with actual incidents, encounters and things that happened.</p>",

Soon after that, I learned about aphantasia and SDAM and I preferred to believe that they rather than anxiety accounted for my difficulties.

			"content_html": "<p>For perhaps the tenth time that oppressive, sticky morning, David wished he’d worn a longer skirt. The calf-length cotton print would have been perfect, but he’d talked himself into putting it back on the rail in the shop, on the grounds that it was an unnecessary expense and didn’t fit his overall “look”. He was now sure that had been a mistake. The skirt was long enough for him to have got away without wearing tights, especially with the new boots, and would have been cool enough to allow him some relief from this hellish heat.</p><p>And as for his “look”, he’d been vaguely aware, for longer than he’d like to admit, that it needed updating. It’s not unusual for men of a certain age to settle into a habitual pattern when it comes to things like clothes, food and everyday activities. Way back when he’d first started openly to dress fem, he’d warned himself that he’d have to be willing to shake things up a bit, to innovate; to get used to living — and dressing — outside his comfort zone. Instead, the comfort zone had expanded just enough to include his new reality, but no wider.</p><p>Though he would never have claimed to have any kind of visual flair, he was still pleased with himself about the look, which he had settled on as long ago as 1994. Of course, it had mutated in the years since. The tan leather jacket had been an inevitable early casualty. But at the start it had been an essential element in achieving that femmasc balance that he thought of as his defining innovation. To start with, he had worn the jacket open, over (if anything) a threadbare and torn t-shirt.</p><p>What hadn’t changed, what remained central to the concept, was the short denim skirt, not quite a mini but well above the knee, worn over thick, black, opaque tights. He loved that style of skirt, must have owned several dozen examples over the years: he was never without one. Neither would he be in the future, even though he was grudgingly coming to recognize that it was time to retire that outfit.</p><p>He had never bothered with a wig or makeup. They didn’t interest him, and it had not been his intention to pass as a woman, quite the contrary. He believed time spent applying makeup to be time inexcusably wasted, and it was hard to imagine himself wearing a wig except as part of a disguise — and disguise was the last thing on his mind. Until recently, he’d had a full head of hair, which he had generally worn long. He had eventually developed the habit of applying nail polish to his fingernails as well as to his toes.</p><p>After he’d got rid of the leather jacket, he varied his tops, while keeping the skirt and tights constant. Often, when the temperature allowed it, he’d wear just a light t-shirt, occasionally a collar and tie and for a while an expensive tweed sports jacket which might have been made to go with a denim skirt. The principle had always been masc above the waist, fem below. Well, with a couple of exceptions. His usual boots, while they perfectly accessorized the tights and skirt, would not have seemed incongruous on a marauding football hooligan; and he sometimes liked to wear a choker that he’d inherited from his mother, set with an emerald. After several years, he finally admitted that he hated the green stone — the baleful eye of a malevolent, monocular alien — so he had it replaced with a garnet.</p><p>Of course, the brightly coloured cotton print skirt would not have been suitable for mourning, but (as he noted with some relief) he clearly wasn’t feeling bereaved. Unless she’d changed more than he could imagine, Tessa wouldn’t have approved of the way he was dressed whatever he’d worn, and she was past caring now. He hadn’t seen her for ages. Without children (who might easily have been in their 30s by now anyway) there had been no reason to keep in touch, though David had followed her career with interest and more than a little vicarious pride.</p><p>David could not say for sure how much his fem dressing had contributed to their breakup, but he had no doubt that the part it had played had been neither negligible nor decisive, though tending more towards the former. Tessa had erupted when he’d announced his intention of dressing like that full-time. She had furiously demanded an explanation, and he’d attempted to provide one. Two, in fact.</p><p>Of the two, he preferred the one that Tessa had evidently not been expecting. He had said it was obvious that there is a strong taboo against men and boys behaving (and that includes dressing) in ways that tend to undermine their masculinity or bring it into question. To breach that taboo is just about the most transgressive thing a male could do without causing harm to another person; and that had made the idea all but irresistible to him.</p><p>David and Tessa had each found his explanations less than convincing, though for different reasons. He believed that both were based on true statements of fact; and that either was, objectively speaking, an adequate explanation (and justification, if one were needed) of the way he dressed, even if neither was, subjectively, his real motivation. The truth was, he didn’t know what his subjective reason was, in spite of having repeatedly, compulsively interrogated himself on the point. The objective explanations were the only ones he had, and they at least had the advantages of being true, and theoretically sufficient.</p><p>Tessa had been inclined to insist on the subjective explanation, and had become increasingly frustrated by David’s refusal or inability to offer a personal and emotional account of what had been going on in his psyche. Some years later, after they had run into each other coming out of a play at the Peacock, and agreed to meet for coffee later in the week, she told him that she had been terrified that he had really wanted to “live as a woman” and maybe even to undergo hormone treatment or surgery. Tessa was in favour of everybody’s right to live however they wanted (provided, of course, that didn’t mean exploiting or oppressing somebody else) and to become whatever they wished to be (within the limits of what was possible). She supported the rights of transgender people — but she had balked at the prospect of finding herself married to one, unexpectedly and against her will.</p><p>David had, of course, disclaimed any desire to <em>be</em> a woman. He did not think of himself as trans. For him, the issue was one of masculinity (and, to the extent that you can’t repudiate one without embracing the other, femininity), not about being male or female. But, because he seemed unable to articulate what it was he wanted and why, Tessa had concluded he must be in denial. She had believed that, unless he were going to remain in a permanent state of indecision, he would sooner or later have to transition. She didn’t want to be still married to him when that happened. (Or, to be fair to her, in any other circumstances.)</p><p>David felt a large bead of sweat roll down the hollow of his back and get trapped by the waistband of his tights. He wanted to tug at his skirt, hold it away from his body to let some cooler air in, but he knew that Tessa would have been furious at him for drawing even more attention to the way he was dressed, as if his clothes weren’t obtrusive enough in themselves. So, he forced himself to stand pokerfaced, ignoring his discomfort largely for her sake. This would be the last thing he would ever have to do for her: he could afford to give her this much, though she was no longer able to appreciate it.</p><p>First thing tomorrow, he’d go back to the shop and see if they still had the print skirt. If not, there would be other suitable clothes, a wider range than he had allowed himself to consider up to now. He might even try on a dress. He was now materially better off than he had been during his marriage or in the years immediately following it. He could afford to have dresses made or altered, so as to fit his massless, zero-dimensional boobs. He’d never worn dresses very much, and not at all since the breakup with Tessa, because he felt he couldn’t carry it off without a stuffed bra. The funny thing was that he actually liked bras, and had enjoyed wearing one on the occasions when he’d permitted himself that indulgence. They felt excitingly unfamiliar, in a way that skirt and tights no longer did for him; the slight tightness around his chest acted as an additional reminder that he was breaking the gender taboo.</p><p>But for years he hadn’t allowed himself to act on his liking for bras, because they were anatomically unwarranted. They smacked of dressing up, which in turn suggested either childish games or attempts to pass as female. If there was one thing that David wanted even less than to pretend to be a woman, it was to treat his fem dressing as a game, a prank, or in any sense frivolous. It was none of these things, but rather an intensely serious effort to free himself from the demands of his masculine traits. A bra had no function to perform in that struggle.</p><p>Or so he had long thought. Now, with no further need to prove to Tessa that his sartorial choices were about anything other than a desire to become a woman, perhaps he could afford to relax his personal dress code just a little. He wouldn’t be throwing out his denim skirts, to be sure, but nor would he be relying on them as his unvarying uniform, like Steve Jobs’s black turtlenecks. If he started to wear dresses regularly that would necessarily mean a departure from his fundamental rule: masc above the waist, fem below.</p><p>A rethink was overdue. Though he wasn’t going to get rid of the skirts, the same was absolutely not true of his tights. Tights might be the most deceptive of garments, delivering almost exactly the opposite of what they promised. They seemed to offer a form-hugging, shape-outlining, limb-clinging barely thereness. Instead, they drooped and sagged, seemed always to be trying to return to a shape that was entirely their own (not yours), regularly required tugging back into place, and refused to let you forget that you were wearing them. Along with their sturdier cousins, leggings, they were probably his least favourite things to wear. He hated them, if anything, even more fiercely than he had hated the boxers he’d once felt obliged to wear.</p><p>The irony was that his inflexible rules of dress had for years denied him the freedom to wear a bra, while requiring him to pull on tights practically every day, and all supposedly in the name of allowing him greater control over how he presented himself to the world. He felt a dangerously compelling urge to tear off his tights then and there. He refused to put up with them a moment longer, and was ready to rip them from his legs, shredding them with long, sharp, purple nails, until all that was left were the tattered wisps of synthetic fabric sticking out of the tops of his boots. To his relief, he was able to resist the impulse: even if Tessa was now permanently out of reach of any embarrassment he might cause her, he still had a responsibility to allow her remains to depart in dignity.</p><p>David was one of the first to leave the crematorium. He hadn’t planned to go to lunch, but now he thought he’d skip the drinks as well. Most of Tessa’s friends at the end were people he didn’t know. Instead, he’d go home, have a shower and change his clothes. Later, he would toast Tessa’s memory privately, alone in a quiet bar they had both liked. As he reached the bus stop, he ran his right thumbnail down the side of his leg and deliberately, surreptitiously, made a small rip in his tights, just at the hemline of his skirt.</p>",

			"content_html": "<h2>Once, in real time, without a rehearsal</h2><p>Two weeks ago, I posted “<a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/unspecific-nostalgia.html\">I think I’m finally over France</a>” in which I looked at my tendency to try to <em>relive</em> episodes and events that have already happened to me, presumably because I’m not able to <em>remember</em> them as vividly as someone who doesn’t have SDAM might do.</p><p>Among the things about the time I lived in France that I’d like to be able to recall, but certainly can’t now relive, are the childhoods of two of my nephews, one of whom is also one of my godsons. They’re now 16 and 17, and were 7 and 8 when I left France at the end of 2011. Since that experience is not relivable, I’d like to think instead about an aspect of my time in France where the relationship between memory and repetition is a bit more complex.</p><p>I’ve never been a great one for going to live music performances. Around about 1980, I went through a bit of a phase, during which I saw Elvis Costello twice, Joe Jackson, The Radiators [from Space], The Police and a handful of other new-wave-type acts. Later in the 80s, during my marriage, I went to quite a few concerts in the National Concert Hall, Dublin. My then wife’s brother played in the RTE Symphony Orchestra, and gave us a steady supply of free or cheap tickets. In 1988, I moved to London and effectively gave up concerts in favour of theatre. I don’t think I went to hear live music again until 2006.</p><p>A couple of years before that, I’d rekindled a liking for jazz piano, initially as a result of hearing the Esbjörn Svensson Trio on Paul Gambaccini’s Jazz FM chart show and buying a few of their albums as a result. Shortly after I moved there, I realized that France provided no shortage of opportunities to hear EST and similar acts live. In fact, at the time, there were many subsidized jazz festivals in France. I started to go to some of them fairly regularly.</p><p>In jazz, live performance is particularly valued. I thought I remembered a quote from someone famous to the effect that a jazz performance is something that happens just once, in real time, without a rehearsal. (Unfortunately, I don’t remember it accurately enough to use Google as an aid to attribution.) As someone without a vivid episodic memory, I might not seem ideally placed to enjoy live, largely improvised music. And, in many ways, I’m not; but it’s a bit more complicated than it appears.</p><p>Most people who have aphantasia find that it’s not just their visual imagination that’s missing. The imagination related to their other senses tends to be affected similarly. That’s true of me too, but my auditory memory is relatively active. I can’t voluntarily recall a smell or a taste any better than I can an image but I can remember sounds. I tend to recognize voices rather than faces, tunes get stuck in my head, I can imagine the sound of a particular instrument, solo or in a group with others, and so on.</p><p>But, while I’m much better at remembering what I heard than what I saw or felt, I’m far from being able to reconstruct a live musical performance in memory. The experience of attending a concert consists of much more than the audio element. I’m not going to remember what I was wearing, where I was sitting in relation to the stage, how well I could see the musicians, how close the instruments were to each other, what the light was like or any of a large number of other factors which will have affected my perception of the performance. Given all this, it’s not all that surprising that, for most of my life, I haven’t shown much enthusiasm for attending gigs or concerts.</p><p>The period from 2005 to 2011, in France, was the longest exception to that rule. Not all of the performances I went to were in France itself, though most were, and France became a handy base for quick trips to some neighbouring countries. I went back to London to see the Marcin Wasilewski Trio at the Pizza Express in Dean Street, Aaron Parks in Ronnie Scott’s and Stefano Bollani in Kings Place; to Amsterdam to see John Taylor, Enrico Pieranunzi and others play solo in the Bimhuis, to the Umbria Jazz Festival in Perugia in 2009 (which I think is the first time Chick Corea and Stefano Bollani played together). I was ready to go to Hamburg to hear John Taylor’s superb trio with Palle Danielsson and Martin France, but the concert was sold out by the time I heard about it. (The trio was supporting Jack DeJohnette.)</p><p>I don’t remember any more than brief flashes of any of the performances I attended. Even the Brad Mehldau Trio in the Theâtre de la Mer, Sète, in July 2008, which I then thought and still think was the best concert I ever attended, has left only vague traces in my memory. </p><p>Most of these concerts were events that I travelled to. From Bordeaux to Antibes, Capbreton to Vernoux-en-Vivarais, Paris to Sète and Marciac to Vitrolles, I generally took a combination of bike and train to get to the venue. Even for events in nearby Toulouse (whose <a href=\"https://www.haute-garonne.fr/jazz-sur-son-31\">Jazz sur son 31</a> festival made October worth looking forward to), I often cycled the 60Km each way, rather than hop on a train, partly to make it seem more of an expedition. I now think that the travel helped me to build up a sense of anticipation, which in turn enhanced my enjoyment of the concert.</p><p>A sense of anticipation is something I tend not to experience spontaneously. The prospect of going to an event — a concert or dramatic performance, a party or celebration, least of all a sporting fixture — does not, in general, get me worked up to a pitch of excitement. I can’t say I <em>never</em> get excited about something that’s about to happen — of course I do — but usually not in the same circumstances as other people seem to. (Naturally, I can’t call to mind a particular occasion before which I felt excited, and so can’t examine what the differences were between that and a more humdrum “event”.)</p><p>I’ve often been puzzled by other people’s apparent ability to feel an anticipatory excitement. I used to wonder how they did it (or if they were faking it) and to some extent I envied their spontaneity. Since I’ve learned about aphantasia, I have (rather obviously) come to suspect that my inability to “picture” future events or incidents is at the root of my reduced capacity for excitement. I’ve written before about <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html\">not having much sense of the future</a> (any more than I have of the past, and for the same reasons). It’s not easy to get excited over something you can’t imagine visually.</p><p>So, it occurs to me that I may have been using certain incidental aspects of going to jazz performances in France — the relative unfamiliarity of the country, the language and the venues, the distances to be travelled — as a kind of counterbalance to the recognition (based on experience but not fully understood because I didn’t yet know about SDAM and aphantasia) that these performances would almost immediately fade from memory, leaving nothing behind but an inert, unevocative ticket stub?</p><p>Some <a href=\"https://www.sunset-sunside.com/concert/2020/10/\">live jazz performances are still taking place</a> during the current pandemic, but I have no intention of going to any of them. At the beginning of the restrictions, the Sunside/Sunset venue put up a notice on their website saying that their survival was threatened by the suspension of live performances. They reopened as soon as they could, <a href=\"https://artkavanagh.micro.blog/2020/06/19/venez-nombreux-et.html\">inviting their audience back in June</a>:</p><blockquote>Venez nombreux et masqués faire la fête du jazz …</blockquote><p>The Sunside is one of my very favourite venues, and I certainly would hate to see it go out of business. But it’s very small, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable sitting in it for an hour or more as part of an audience that outnumbered the band.</p><p>Perhaps the pandemic and its attendant restrictions are providing the necessary opportunity to think again about the way I listen to jazz. People who know about jazz, as I’ve suggested above, believe that this is music that should be listened to live, in the moment, as it is created. It’s played by improvisors who, as they play, bring into existence a unique, new work. Its audience should likewise be experiencing, in the moment, something that has never been heard before and that can never (even if it’s recorded) be heard again <em>in the same way</em>.</p><p>If this opinion is correct, I’ve never remotely resembled the ideal listener to jazz. Rather than pay full attention to a one-time-only performance, I listen constantly, repeatedly and with a fluctuating level of concentration to <em>recordings</em> of such performances. It’s not unusual for these to be live albums. Even when they’re not live, they’re very often single-take, unedited studio recordings with no overdubs. The tracks for individual instruments may be remixed, the sound balance adjusted, echo removed and other sound engineering techniques employed, but the notes, chords, rests etc are those actually played by the musicians. So, I’m listening to a recording of a performance that really happened, not an assemblage of clips and edits.</p><p>But, unlike the performance, the process of listening happens over and over and over again. I’ve occasionally felt obscurely guilty about that, as if I were a kind of fraud. (But on the other hand, why would anybody buy an album with the intention of listening to it only once?) It’s likely that the way I listen to jazz from now on will not change very much. But, because of a combination of the pandemic restrictions and the recognition that my unresisted impulse to return to France was probably caused by my deficient episodic memory, I expect that the way I <em>feel</em> about how I listen to jazz will change fundamentally. I’ll certainly continue to listen to albums, both live and studio, many times each.</p><p>At some point, when I’m convinced it’s safe to do so, I’m sure I’ll start going to live  performances again. Maybe not in France and probably, now that Brexit is a reality, not in London. But I’ve wanted to go back to the Bimhuis since the first time I was there. And though I’ll never have another opportunity to hear John Taylor play live, I’d still like to visit some of the well known German venues sooner or later. The difference is I’ll know that my memories of these events will soon afterwards fade from “episodic” to “semantic”. I hope that, now that I know a bit more about how my mind works, I’ll resist the temptation to go back to somewhere I lived before, in futile pursuit of these elusive recollections.</p>",

			"title": "The books I left behind — and some I didn’t",
			"content_html": "<p>When I returned to Ireland in 2011, I left a lot of my possessions in my sister’s attic near Toulouse. This included a HP LaserJet printer, an amplifier and two speakers, a substantial CD collection (most of which I had ripped to iTunes, so I no longer needed the physical media), a television and some DVDs. But most of what I left behind were books. Many of them were general reading: fiction of varying degrees of seriousness as well as some popular nonfiction. There were also the books I had been using in my doctoral work on Andrew Marvell. These fell into three categories: literary criticism and scholarship, seventeenth-century political and constitutional history, and some more specialized topics, notably the argument between Grotius and Selden on the international law of the sea. All in all, there were several heavy boxes of sometimes weighty tomes. Although I had occasionally gone back to retrieve a particular book or two, they had for the most part rested undisturbed for the last nine years.</p><p>On Thursday, having come to the conclusion that I could neither leave them there indefinitely nor find a suitable permanent place for them all, I went through the boxes to sort out which books I absolutely wanted to keep and which I was prepared to leave to be dumped/donated/sold/whatever. There were a few difficult decisions but generally the process turned out to be much easier than I’d been expecting.</p><h3>Fiction</h3><p>I took everything by Michael Dibdin that I could find, including the first seven books in his Aurelio Zen series (or all but one of them: I’m not sure I found <cite>Dead Lagoon</cite>). I’ve been meaning for a long time to write something about Zen’s moral trajectory over the course of the series. I have the last three books in Ireland, so <cite>And Then You Die</cite> may be the only one I’m missing. (It, of course, is central to my argument: the nadir of the trajectory.)</p><p>I left behind the first four or five of Jeff Lindsay’s Dexter series, even though I have two of the later novels in Ireland. I had a vague idea of rereading them to confirm (or not) my impression that they’re satires in which the self-described “monster” repeatedly fails to recognize that he isn’t really any morally worse than the unending stream of ordinary psychopaths, egotists and narcissists from among whom he chooses his victims.</p><p>I took most of the Scott Turow novels I could find, including my disintegrating paperback copy of <cite>The Burden of Proof</cite>, which could do with being replaced anyway. (I still think it’s his best novel, though it has competition from <cite>Personal Injuries</cite>.) The two I didn’t take were <cite>The Laws of Our Fathers</cite> (an ambitious failure, in my view) and <cite>Pleading Guilty</cite> (which I love and will certainly reread). The first of these was showing signs of damp and the second is a trade paperback, which I’ll replace with a more manageable mass market paperback when necessary. I don’t remember seeing <cite>Ordinary Heroes</cite>, which I know I had in hardback. I wonder what happened to it.</p><p>I took Wilkie Collins’s <cite>Armadale</cite> but left behind several other books of his, including <cite>The Moonstone</cite>, <cite>Basil</cite> and <cite>The Law and the Lady</cite>. I’m not entirely sure why I left them: I’d certainly like to read <cite>Basil</cite> again, at least.</p><p>I decided to keep everything I could find by Andrew Taylor except <cite>Caroline Minuscule</cite>, which I’ve already reread to death (another disintegrating paperback).</p><p>I’ve wanted to reread Ian McEwan’s <cite>Enduring Love</cite> almost since I originally read it, so I was glad to get it back. The only other book by McEwan that I took was <cite>Amsterdam</cite>, a very slim volume. My battered, 32-year-old copy of <cite>The Child in Time</cite> needs to be replaced, <cite>The Innocent</cite> is an unwieldy trade paperback and I’m probably never going to read <cite>Atonement</cite> again. My copy of <cite>Saturday</cite> is already in Ireland.</p><p>Note: Enduring Love and Amsterdam: I have said before (too often) that McEwan won the Booker <em>with</em> <cite>Amsterdam</cite> but <em>for</em> the immediately preceding <cite>Enduring Love</cite>, much as Peter Carey won with <cite>Oscar and Lucinda</cite> but for <cite>Illywhacker</cite>.</p><p>The first two books by Peter Abrahams that I read were <cite>Oblivion</cite> and <cite>Nerve Damage</cite>. I took both, though I’ve reread <cite>Oblivion</cite> probably more than once. I’m looking forward to my second read of <cite>Nerve Damage</cite>.</p><p>I decided to keep <cite>Dubliners</cite> but left behind <cite>A Portrait of the Artist</cite>, even though I believe that Joyce is a much better novelist than he is a short story writer. I suspect that <cite>Dubliners</cite> wouldn’t get as much attention as it does if it weren’t the more accessible work of an author whose novels are certainly difficult. Perhaps I kept <cite>Dubliners</cite> so that I can again test that suspicion. And why couldn’t I find my copy of <cite>Ulysses</cite>?</p><h3>Nonfiction</h3><p>I left behind a lot of nonfiction. I had long intended to reread John Lanchester’s <cite>Whoops! Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay</cite> but I probably should have done so before its moment passed. The same with Cass Sunstein and Richard Epstein, <cite>The Vote</cite> and Ian Ayres, <cite>Supercrunchers</cite>. (Remember, these books have been lying there since 2011.) I <em>did</em> retrieve Steven Pinker’s <cite>The Language Instinct</cite>, but nothing else of his. In fact, I couldn’t see any other books by him, though my enthusiasm for <cite>The Language Instinct</cite> led me to binge-read several of his books in the mid 2000s, including <cite>How the Mind Works</cite> and <cite>The Blank Slate</cite>. Where did they all get to? I’m beginning to wonder if there isn’t an overlooked a box that I forgot to open.</p><h3>Literary criticism</h3><p>One book I was particularly keen to recover was Christopher Ricks’s <cite>Essays in Appreciation</cite>, which includes his brilliant reading of <cite>Doctor Faustus</cite>, inspired by William Empson’s highly idiosyncratic one.</p><p>As for Empson himself, I abandoned a lot: everything, in fact, except <cite>Seven Types of Ambiguity</cite> and <cite>Milton’s God</cite>. Again, I’m not sure why I made this choice: I think it was more instinctive than thought out. Perhaps I felt that there was a risk of letting Empson overshadow my future work. I’ve wanted for almost 25 years to write about his interpretation of <cite>Faustus</cite>. If I write anything else to do with Empson, it will be about his essay on Marvell’s marriage, where he arrived (apparently by instinct) at something very close to the truth, by way of a series of factual mistakes, unsupported assumptions and misreadings of historical records. I already have what I need for those two pieces.</p><p>Where Marvell is concerned, I couldn’t possibly leave behind Rosalie Colie’s <cite>My Ecchoing Song: Andrew Marvell’s Poetry of Criticism</cite>, but there was plenty that I <em>did</em> leave, including a box of photocopies of scholarly articles, and many solid, valuable, hardback books in good condition. Thinking about it a day later I was quite impressed, but also a little horrified, at my own ruthlessness. I’ll try to explain <em>why</em> I was so ruthless in the next section.</p><h3>History</h3><p>As far as I remember, I took almost nothing that falls into this category. I know I hesitated over the three volumes of Richard Tuck’s edition of Hugo Grotius, <cite>The Rights of War and Peace</cite>. They had been expensive and would be hard to replace, but on the other hand they are very bulky and I couldn’t be sure that I’d ever need to consult them again. Other substantial books I left behind included Glenn Burgess, <cite>Absolute Monarchy and the Stuart Constitution</cite>, J. G. A. Pocock’s <cite>The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law</cite> and quite a bit more in or near the same vein.</p><p>In each case, my thinking was that I <em>now</em> want to write about Marvell from an accessible, critical perspective rather than a rigorous, scholarly, historical one. This is not in the least to disparage rigorous historical scholarship. I admire it hugely and recognize that it’s the indispensible underpinning without which a great deal of criticism would be nothing more than groundless speculation. But the fact is that I (like most people, I imagine) am much better at groundless speculation than I am at rigorous scholarship and having made an attempt at the latter while I was writing my thesis, I now wish to concentrate my attention on the former. </p><h3>Poetry</h3><p>I saved the <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/poetry-scholarly-editions.html\">Margoliouth/Legouis edition</a> of Marvell’s <cite>Poems and Letters</cite>. I didn’t think it was acceptable to separate the volumes and take the Poems but not the Letters, so I made room for the latter. I also got William Empson’s <cite>Collected Poems</cite>, apparently undamaged, though some other books in the same box were showing the effects of damp. One of these was the Norton edition of Robert Browning’s poetry. I think I decided to take it anyway, though I don’t clearly remember packing it. In general, I don’t like the Norton editions very much: in this one the pages are too narrow in proportion to their length and it’s too tightly bound. But I need some kind of edition of Browning and this will do in a pinch. I took my hardback <cite>New Oxford Book of Victorian Verse</cite> edited by Christopher Ricks, but left the Penguin Classic edition of Arthur Hugh Clough.</p><p>To my surprise, I didn’t hesitate to take Yeats. (Perhaps I felt that I haven’t finished with him yet.) I also took Auden and Larkin, but not Eliot, Hardy, Herrick, Donne or Milton. I particularly wanted to find my copy of <cite>Selected Poems of Louis MacNeice</cite> but there was no sign of it. Another volume in the hypothetical overlooked box? Anyway, that gives me all the excuse I need to buy that or a different edition of MacNeice’s poetry.</p><h3>A glaring absence?</h3><p>I see that all but one of the authors I’ve mentioned are men. That gives a misleading impression of my current reading habits. In fact, I did pack some books by women but just one book each: Sophie Hannah, Karin Alvtegen, Melissa Bank, Emily Brontë and Rebecca Goldstein (now that I think of it, two in her case, one fiction, one non) are the names that immediately come to mind. I would have taken Kate Atkinson’s <cite>Case Histories</cite> or <cite>One Good Turn</cite> if I’d found either of them but they must be in the overlooked box. I hesitated over Zadie Smith’s <cite>White Teeth</cite> but in the end decided to leave it.</p><p>So that’s it. Inevitably not a perfect choice, since I can’t predict exactly what books I’m going to want to read again in the future or which ones I may need to refer to. But I feel that I’ve freed the ones I selected from the collective weight of their never-again-to-be-read fellows, as well as from their inaccessible location at the back of an attic in Occitanie. That feeling has put a certain lightness in my step in the few days since.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>I stopped using RSS around the same time that Google closed Google Reader, but not <em>because</em> of that. As far as I remember, I hadn’t really been aware of Google Reader till I read the announcement of its end. I’ve never really liked web-based readers or used them much: I preferred an approach that allowed me to read feeds in the browser (as both Safari and IE11 did) and it was when Safari dropped that feature that I gave up on feeds, a decision reinforced by the fact that I was then relying more on Twitter to let me know when updates had been posted.</p><p>Then, two years ago, I read that Brent Simmons had resumed ownership of NetNewsWire and was working on a new version. At the time I was without a Mac, so I decided to try Reeder 3 on iPad, while waiting for NetNewsWire to be released on that platform. I later upgraded to Reeder 4 and I’m now happily using the iPad version of NetNewsWire, without syncing. It’s nice to be back.</p><p>I have some reservations about RSS, though. First, I suppose, is the fact that it’s in XML, which I’ve always thought to be unnecessarily complex for many (obviously not all) of the uses it’s been put to. Brent Simmons (again) and Manton Reece have demonstrated this point by creating the specification for <a href=\"https://www.jsonfeed.org/\">JSON Feed</a>, which is a lot more straightforward. My own site consists of static web pages (including this post) from which I can’t automatically generate a feed, so I’ve been offering just a JSON Feed, which I update by hand whenever I post something new.</p><p>I include the full text of the relevant web page as HTML, something that is allowed for in the specification. This has brought it home to me that there’s a degree of duplication, which should ideally be avoided.</p><p>My second reservation is that the RSS approach depends on individual readers <em>following</em> the feeds of sites they want to be updated about. I’m personally <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/following.html\">not very taken with the “following” model</a>. It strikes me as too insistent, too FOMO, almost obsessive. I’m not going to read <em>everything</em> that <a href=\"https://memex.naughtons.org/feed\">John Naughton</a> or <a href=\"https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/feed/\">Richard Murphy</a> posts (probably not even most of it), and if there were an alternative I wouldn’t want to be notified every time they put out something new. On the other hand, I’m even less keen that an algorithm should choose which posts it’s going to tell me about. Experience with Twitter, Facebook and other social media suggests that algorithms really aren’t very good at this. Ideally, I’d like my browser to pop up an unobtrusive notification saying something like “You haven’t visited <a href=\"https://alanralph.co.uk/feed/\">Alan Ralph’s site</a> for a few weeks. There are some new posts. Would you like to take a look?”</p><p>The third reservation is that your feed reader presents everything in the same style. If we’re going to read every story in black San Francisco on a white background, why should anybody bother paying attention to what their site looks like? If the design and style are more than just incidental decoration, shouldn’t we be reading the page in its intended setting? (Not everybody would agree with this, of course. On Micro.blog, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Miraz/\">@Miraz</a> said that she has set her Safari preferences so that <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Miraz/10297173\">sites open in Reader View by default</a>.)</p><p>So, I think what I’d like to see is that feeds and updates should be handled by the browser, which will know whenever a page/site is updated. The individual would be able to add URLs to a list of sites to be watched. Ideally, it shouldn’t be necessary for the browser to poll these sites more often than 2 or 3 times a week. Many of the sites on the watch list would be infrequently updated. (That’s why they need to be on the list in the first place.) In those cases, the person should be notified of each update. In the case of busier sites, an occasional reminder should be issued if she hasn’t visited the site in a while.</p><p>If the individual decides to visit the updated page, it should be displayed in the browser in the usual way. Journalists and others who need to keep on top of a rapidly changing field would still need feed readers but the rest of us would, I think, find it more convenient to be reminded of updates in our browsers.</p><p>Similar approaches have been tried before. Mozilla discontinued Live Bookmarks in Firefox, presumably because the feature wasn’t used enough to justify the cost of maintaining it. In any case, it was effectively an RSS feed reader, whereas what I’m suggesting would mean incorporating feed elements directly into the web page.</p><p>There’s also Kicks Condor’s browser extension, <a href=\"https://fraidyc.at\">Fraidy Cat</a>, which is a lot of fun but, again, relies in part on RSS feeds and anyway looks like a (brilliant) browser extension rather than a feature that is wholly integrated into the browser.</p><p>The difference between what I’m suggesting and the current system of notifications is that notifications are initiated by the publisher, not the reader. In my proposal, the individual would choose in her own good time what to add to the watch list, whereas under the present system the site asks for permission to show notifications, perhaps at a moment when she doesn’t want to think about that because she’s busy trying to read a post. I don’t believe I’ve <em>ever</em> consented to being sent notifications by a website, yet I’m clearly amenable to the idea of being told about updates, as I’m following 50 feeds in NetNewsWire.</p><p>Another problem with notifications is that they’re often offered by frequently updated sites, though the feature would obviously be more useful for sites that change only occasionally.</p><p>Ultimately, I suppose my point is that it seems unnecessary that HTML and RSS should be two different things. I dare say there’s a good reason why they have to remain separate, but from my (nondeveloper) point of view, it appears to make sense to incorporate the essential features of the latter into the former.</p>",

			"content_html": "<h2>I may have been trying to relive my experiences in actuality because I can’t recapture them in memory</h2><p>I’ve just spent the last 7 weeks living in a succession of cheapish hotels in Pau and Tarbes, towns in the southern French regions of Nouvelle Aquitaine and Occitanie respectively. I had intended to move from Ireland to France back in March, but then the restrictions on movement were suddenly introduced, and I ended up spending 5 months as an unvited guest in my sister’s house in Dublin. So, once the restrictions were lifted, I had to move quickly.</p><p>A lot of my time over this 7-week period has been spent trying and repeatedly failing to rent a studio apartment for the next year. I don’t intend to bore you with the reasons why I can’t find a place to live but, partly because of them, I think I’ve lost my enthusiasm for living in France.</p><p>I spent 6 months in Bordeaux in 2015 and found somewhere to stay within 10 days. The difference is that, at that time, I was looking for a houseshare, whereas now (partly because of the virus, but also because I’d like to have my own place to myself) I’m trying to find a studio apartment. I’d have expected that people would be more wary about sharing their own homes than about letting out an impersonal property asset, but I got that quite wrong.</p><p>So where do I go from here? There are practical problems about going back to Ireland (I’d have to have somewhere to wait out 14 days’ isolation, for a start, and then find a place to live long-term). And then there are the emotional obstacles.</p><p>In 2011, I moved back to Ireland, having lived outside the country for 24 years, 18 of those in London. Throughout my time away, I had felt nostalgic for Dublin — for that city specifically, not for Ireland as a country. But I wasn’t able to attach that feeling of nostalgia to any particular place, event or experience. (From this point on, I’m going to refer to that feeling as “unspecific nostalgia” for reasons that I hope will become clear.) </p><p>I used to say to a very good friend of mine from Holland (who also lived in London and who died in 2006) that he must come to Dublin; he’d really like it. What would he like about it? he would ask me. I’d go blank. It was hard to say what was so good about the place, apart from a fleeting feeling as one walked along a particular street. It was a generalized atmosphere, impossible to put one’s finger on. But he’d see when he got there. (As it turned out, he never did.)</p><p>When I’d go back for visits (and for my mother’s funeral in 1999), the anticipated generalized atmosphere and fleeting feelings would elude me; but I’d tell myself that this was because I was just passing through, it would be different if I were living there every day. So, when the chance to return to Ireland came up at the end of 2011, I took it.</p><p>I soon began to believe I’d made a dreadful mistake. Dublin was not the place it had been in my imagination. (It hardly could have been, because my imagination was, as I later discovered, incorrigibly nonvisual, and therefore the incapable of capturing certain fundamental characteristics of the place.) Again, it was hard to put my finger on what exactly was wrong. The colours were all off, for a start. The trees were too green to be natural (as, indeed, were many things.) To me, the air in Dublin suggested an alien atmosphere, tinged with a purplish blue, possibly poisonous and certainly inimical to life, whereas that in France had been warm, brown and orange, welcoming. I had to get out of Ireland and go back to France.</p><p>Again, brief visits should have allowed me to view my fantasies with a clearer eye. I spent a few days at a time in France in each of the three years following my return to Ireland, mainly for jazz performances (the Brad Mehldau trio near Toulon, several pianists in Marciac, Enrico Pieranunzi at the Sunside and Martial Solal in Aix) but also for my youngest sister’s 50th birthday. The France of brief visits didn’t match that of my nostalgic imagination but that didn’t stop me from wanting to back permanently.</p><p>I’ve also just recently noticed that I’ve been feeling an inclination to return to London, which I’d happily left for good in 2005 (and again in 2006). I think a pattern is becoming clear, according to which I develop unspecific nostalgia for places where I used to live, and this nostalgia makes itself felt in the form of a strong desire to go back to that place and relive the experiences I had there. I know, theoretically, that the past can’t be relived. I believe it’s because of this cognitive awareness that I didn’t attempt to move back to Dublin during the 1990s or 2000s, despite the feeling that I’d be happier there than in London or France. The feeling was always resistible — until 2012 when it hit me with a double whammy: I was back in Ireland at last, simultaneously “missing” France and learning that the Dublin that I thought I’d been pining after for the past 24 years had very little correspondence with reality.</p><p>Of course, when I was living in London in the 1990s and longing for an idealized but vague and curiously featureless idea of Dublin, or in Dublin in the early 2010s, desperately missing an equally abstract notion of France, I didn’t yet know that I have <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2db66c17c5f3\">SDAM</a>: I learned about that only in 2018. Now that I’ve been back to France with an awareness of that condition, and have again found it a disappointment, I’m speculating that the mismatch between my expectations and observable reality has something to do with my lack of vivid memories and my inability to form mental images.</p><p>I now suspect that the unspecific nostalgia comes from feelings of pleasure, enjoyment and validation that were originally stimulated by incidents and experiences that I can’t remember except as forming part of a dry, featureless narrative. The feelings are still there, even though they’re not attached to memories, as I assume they would be for someone who doesn’t have SDAM. Lacking a grounding in memory, they’ve instead become associated in my mind with the abstract notion of the place (Dublin, certain parts of France). Not being able to relive the experiences in memory, I’m drawn to try to relive them in actuality, which of course is not possible.</p><p>Now that I think I know what’s happening, I should be better able to resist the urge to “go back”. The attempt to substitute equivalent new experiences for my nonexistent episodic memories is irrational and doomed, but it has taken me at least the last 9 years to understand that. I thought I was missing France or Dublin. In fact, what I lacked were the memories of incidents that had occurred in these places.</p><p>The lesson to be learned from this is that it doesn’t matter where I live. Wherever it might be, I’ll have some good experiences, and some not-so-good ones there. While I’ll certainly remember that some of them happened, I won’t remember them in such a way as to recall them to mind, or “relive” them. The good experiences will evoke pleasant feelings which will not, unfortunately, be connected to memories of the occasions that gave rise to them, and will therefore merge into another bout of unspecific nostalgia. There’s nothing I can do about it but recognize it for what it is.</p><p>I’ve been attaching too much importance to the question <em>where</em> I want to live. Really, the important thing now is to find a room <em>some</em>where with a desk, a chair, a reasonable amount of space for the books I need in the medium term, and a supply of electricity and water. I have at least one book and several shorter writing projects that I’d like to finish while I can still write. They’re <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/writing-purpose.html\">my priority now</a>. I don’t want to spend any more time looking for the ideal surroundings in which to write them.</p><p>It may even be the case that being in the “wrong” place, the place where I don’t want to be, may be good for my writing. 2012, the year of the double whammy, when I was at my most unhappy since I left school 38 years previously, was the year when I finally finished, submitted and defended my doctoral thesis and got started on <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/10.1093/escrit/cgw006\">the publication of which I’m most proud</a> (so far). I continued to work on that essay over the following year and in 2014 I wrote the first draft of <cite>A Falling Body</cite>.</p><p>From the beginning of 2016 through to September 2019, I was flat broke and living in a borrowed apartment in a dull, uninspiring Irish town where I wrote <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">several short stories</a>, some <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss\">critical discussion of books and ficton</a> and my posts about <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html\">aphantasia/SDAM</a> as well as a bunch of more ephemeral stuff. So, if writing is really to be my priority from now on, maybe it’s time I went looking for a bare, cheap studio or bedsit (if such a thing is to be found) in another uninteresting Irish town. But first, I need to figure out what to do about the 14 days’ isolation. Je vous tiendrai au courant.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>Almost the first thing I posted after I registered my own domain name and set up a static site on GitHub Pages was <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/HTML-Markdown.html\">this piece comparing Markdown and HTML</a>. At the time, I was thinking of HTML as cumbersome, full of redundancies and awkward to write, and was in the first flush of early enthusiasm about Markdown, which I had been aware of but hadn’t really used up to that point.</p><p>After a few months using GitHub Pages, I decided that it would be easier to write my posts in simple HTML with a rudimentary CSS style sheet than to learn how to modify Jekyll themes. Since then, I’ve been writing all the posts on this site in HTML. It works but there are some little things that irritate me about it.</p><p>Most of the tags used in a normal post are going to be for paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) elements, so I just forget about these for the time being and type paragraphs of text separated by blank lines, as in Markdown. For most other things — headings, blockquotes, emphasis, citing book and journal titles, lists, notes (i.e. details/summary), I type the HTML tags out in full. None of these is common enough to make that a problem. Same with links and images: with these, I prefer the HTML approach to Markdown’s, even though it requires me to type straight double quotes (another redundancy: Markdown does fine without them) while I usually write with “smart” quotes turned on.</p><p>The resulting document should be valid Markdown, although it doesn’t contain  any Markdown syntax. Once I’ve got a complete draft, I change the extension from .txt to .md (if necessary) and open my document in iA Writer, which I use for no other purpose than to convert Markdown to HTML! (I bought the iPad version to try it out, so I might as well do something with it, even if not actual <em>writing</em>.)</p><p>I then edit the HTML document in a text editor: adding a stylesheet link and meta description — and occasionally some embedded styles — to the head, and pasting in my standard header at the top of the body.</p><p>You may be asking why I don’t use Markdown for the headings, blockquotes, emphasis etc? It would work equally well. The reason is that, having written in Markdown regularly over a period of months, I realized that I’m not very enthusiastic about it. The principle of avoiding HTML’s redundancies appeals to me; the methods chosen don’t. They’re expressly based on plain text email conventions: underscores for emphasis, greater-than to begin a block quote, a blank line to indicate a new paragraph.</p><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I used to subscribe to the Milton-L mailing list, a discussion group conducted by email. The thing about Milton-L that used to drive me mad was that there was no way to distinguish the title of a book or journal from the surrounding text. Some people used underscores but I always thought that was an unsatisfactory workaround.</p><p>This approach — writing mainly plain text with some HTML tags — works perfectly well if I want (as I usually do) to produce a HTML document to be posted on my site. But it’s getting tantalizingly close to the ideal state of being able to do everything as plain text.</p><p>One reason why I avoided HTML for many years was that when I first used it, I had to type a lot of entities to represent non-ASCII characters: &amp;rdquo;, &amp;apos;, &amp;hellip;, &amp;eacute; and &amp;mdash; for example. Typing these was unbelievably disruptive to the flow of the writing. The use of UTF-8 encoding has removed this difficulty. As a result, writing HTML is a much less frustrating experience than it used to be.</p><p>As it has become possible to type as plain text nearly all the characters I need, it has seemed somehow redundant to have to rely on an external style sheet or document-type specification for presentation and structure. On the other hand, it seems to me that a lot of the documents I write (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/protected.txt\">a short story</a>) don’t have a very complex visual structure. So, I began to wonder if it wouldn’t be possible to do the whole thing in text, without any additional markup.</p><p>The elements that I typically might need to use in a document are these (with, in the third column, my suggestions as to how they might be indicated using only plain text):</p><table><colgroup><col width=\"25%\"><col width=\"20%\"><col width=\"55%\"></colgroup><tr><th>Element</th><th>HTML</th><th>Plain text equivalent</th></tr><tr><td>Title</td><td>&lt;title&gt;</td><td>ALL UPPERCASE</td></tr><tr><td>First level heading</td><td>&lt;h1&gt;</td><td>Use Title Case if You Don’t Mind</td></tr><tr><td>Second level heading</td><td>&lt;h2&gt;</td><td>Short line (no more than 40 characters), with only one line break at the end; text following the line break is treated as a normal paragraph</td></tr><tr><td>Normal paragraph</td><td>&lt;p&gt;</td><td>Double line break at the end (unless it’s the last paragraph in the document)</td></tr><tr><td>Block quote</td><td>&lt;blockquote&gt;</td><td>Separate from the preceding and succeeding paragraphs with 3 line breaks rather than 2</td></tr><tr><td>Line break</td><td>&lt;br&gt;</td><td>A line break (I don’t put breaks in the middle of paragraphs unless a break is intended, and I invariably have word-wrap turned on)</td></tr><tr><td>Emphasis</td><td>&lt;em&gt;</td><td>Try to make it clear from the context when emphasis is intended; if you absolutely, positively must emphasize a word or phrase, put an asterisk immediately before and after it: underscores look messier and less “finished” than asterisks</td></tr><tr><td>Citaton</td><td>&lt;cite&gt;</td><td>There’s no way to avoid some markup for this one, I’m afraid: I suggest using braces (curly brackets) as in Henry Fielding, {The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling} or {The New Yorker}</td></tr><tr><td>Numbered list</td><td>&lt;ol&gt;</td><td>See list item below</td></tr><tr><td>List item</td><td>&lt;li&gt;</td><td>Just put a number at the start of the line: if there are no more than 5 or 6 items, it’s easy to keep track of the numbers; I don’t use bulleted lists very much (I’ve never seen the point), but a suitable nonalphanumeric character will be fine</td></tr><tr><td>Expandable note</td><td>&lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt;</td><td>Where possible avoid notes, which are a distraction that at best disrupt the reading experience; (instead, try to incorporate references, asides etc into the text using parentheses if necessary)</td></tr></table><p>That leaves links and images. To take the latter first, you’re dealing with a text file: any images are necessarily going to be separate. I’d be inclined just to put something in the text like “Figure 1: The author’s family tree” and name the image files to make it clear which goes where. As for links, well, again this is meant to be text, not hypertext. If you’re referring to something the reader can easily search for on Google, DDG, Bandcamp or a relevant app store etc, don’t bother with a link. Your reader is not a helpless infant. If you find it necessary to include a URL, the convention of surrounding it with angle brackets will work just as well here as anywhere else. (I may have more to say about hypertext and links in a follow-up post.)</p><p>This approach won’t be ideal for everything, of course. If you’re writing a web page, you might as well go full HTML, with links, images, headers, notes and so on. If you’re producing academic writing, you’re going to need notes and a more robust approach to citation than I recommend here. But for things like email newsletters, or documents that might be opened, read and edited on any system, I believe that my suggestion has something to recommend it. I’m certainly going to try it out myself.</p>",

I’ve never seen Gina Gershon give a better performance than she does as Corky, and Jennifer Tilly slyly undermines her high-voiced, “girly” persona.</p><p>So I had high hopes for <cite>The Matrix</cite> but I’m sorry to say they weren’t realized. I found the film plodding, unsubtle and over-reliant on special effects, with a plot that seemed incomplete (as if the film-makers were holding back part of the story for the sequels). In particular, I found the “reality isn’t what you think it is, it’s something completely different” theme dissatisfying and fantastic (not in a good sense). I never bothered to watch the sequels. I always meant to go back and give <cite>The Matrix</cite> a second chance, to see if I’ve been unfair to it (a distinct possibility) but that has never seemed an urgent project in the 18 years or so since I saw it.</p><p>Then, recently, Jennifer Harrison (<a href=\"https://micro.blog/GeneticJen\">GeneticJen</a> on Micro.blog) reposted an essay that she had originally published on Medium 3 years ago, in which she examines the argument that <cite>The Matrix</cite> can be viewed as <a href=\"https://geneticjen.micro.blog/2020/08/21/some-thoughts-and.html\">a trans allegory</a>. That led me to Google, where I learned that there’s a whole online discussion of this very question that seems to have been going on for some time. One contribution that caught my eye was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/3/30/18286436/the-matrix-wachowskis-trans-experience-redpill\">a story on <cite>Vox</cite> by Emily VanDerWerff</a>, who puts her finger on exactly what I don’t like about <cite>The Matrix</cite>:</p><blockquote>The entire movie is about transcending the limitations of the physical form to explore what the mind is capable of. Bodies are, at best, a suggestion. Your brain is what really matters.</blockquote><p>I fundamentally disagree that the brain is “what really matters” and the body little more than a bundle of limitations that exists primarily to be transcended. The idea that the body is just a adjunct to the “real” self (whether that self is conceived of as “the mind”, “the soul” or some other kind of inner essential being) is a commonplace in European thought, literature and religion. I have long believed that it’s completely wrong and treacherously deceptive.</p><p>A person’s body is central to the way she exists in the world. It initially registers the sensory inputs — sight, taste, sensation, hearing and smell — that the brain then processes. It includes (among much else) the digestive and cardio-vascular systems that keep the whole organism alive. It’s responsible for speech and all actions taken by the individual. If we assume that a disembodied brain <em>could</em> exist at all, it would be completely isolated from the world, unable to communicate, to perceive anything or even to nourish itself. It could not survive for very long.</p><p>Even in this last paragraph, I’ve been treating body and mind as if they were distinct parts of the human being, capable of having an existence separate from each other. This is not what I believe, but is simply a piece of conceptual shorthand. Body and mind are <em>both</em> integral and essential to the complete person. We are accustomed to think of them as distinct only for analytical purposes.</p><p>They’re really nothing more than ways of trying to grasp different aspects of the same big, complex, multifaceted, organic thing (the human individual) but they don’t in reality correspond to an actual division or divisibility within that thing. A body without a mind is a corpse; a mind without a body merely a fantasy.</p><p>That’s the main reason I’ve never been able to accept formulations like “born in the wrong body” (which mercifully one hears less often now that people wanting to transition have fewer gatekeepers to persuade). A living body is not a vessel or container <em>in</em> which the essential self is carried around. Nor is it a piece of organic machinery which is employed (for want of something better) by a ghostly intelligence to mediate between itself and the “external”, physical world. On the contrary, the body is an integral part of the human being, a part that can’t be separated or disentangled from the being as a whole.</p><p>I fully understand that this is not how the body appears to us in our self-perceptions. I’ve <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2db66c17c5f3\">written before</a> more than once about <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/e0c93850ffb1\">not having a visual self-image</a>. I <em>do</em> have a self-conception, however, and I’ve been thinking a lot about what form that self-conception takes. It’s not easy to be sure, because the idea seems to slip away as I try to examine it directly. But, as far as I can tell, I imagine myself (at least some of the time) as a blob of consciousness, occupying the same physical position as my cranium but slightly larger and with less distinct edges.</p><p>Of course, that self-conception is <em>obviously wrong</em>. I’m perfectly well aware that it’s wrong. I <em>know</em> that I’m an overweight, white, Irish male, in need of a haircut and about 1.81 metres in height. But that’s not how I experience my own being. (When I was much younger, I used to enjoy the “Oh, <em>that’s</em> what I look like” moment when I’d unexpectedly catch sight of my reflection. For some years now, the surprise hasn’t been nearly so pleasant but it’s still a surprise.)</p><p>Now it’s possible that, because I can’t visualize, I have a more <em>obviously</em> distorted self-conception than most. Be that as it may, I’m convinced that people generally have an inaccurate and misleading image or conception of themselves. Why we as a species should have evolved that way I can’t say, but I’m not in any doubt that we have done so. For some reason, we seem to be better adapted to survival if we can manage to believe that “we” are insulated by our physical attributes from our environment, and that we exist somehow apart from it. Intellectually, we know that this is an illusion. We should try not to forget that fact.</p><p>Probably, this distorted self-image is one of the factors that makes it possible for us to devalue the body: to see our consciousness as the <em>essential</em> thing and our physical characteristics as incidental and subsidiary, just the container. In any case, I think it’s worth making a special effort to give the body its (easily overlooked) due. I think something like this is partly what J K Rowling had in mind when she provoked a lot of anger by <a href=\"https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/\">insisting that “sex is real”</a>. Sex is, I suspect, the area of human activity and entity where the interdependence and inseparability of mind and body are at their most obvious and undeniable.</p><p>So, I interpret Rowling’s remarks as implying that “bodies are real, and indispensable”, and in that sense (though <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/gender-identity.html\">not exclusively in that sense</a>) I fundamentally agree with it.</p><p>I think the time has come when I should finally rewatch <cite>The Matrix</cite>, with more critical attention than I gave it 18 years ago. Depending on how that goes, I might even watch the sequels. But I’m not going to be surprised if I don’t enjoy them.</p>",
