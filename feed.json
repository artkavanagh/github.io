			"title": "Its hour come round at last: Brian Moore, Catholics",
			"content_html": "<p>This is the second work of fiction I’ve read recently that was set in the near future when it was written, but where the imagined future period has now become part of our past. Last week, I wrote about Philip Kerr’s <cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite>, written in 1992 about a futuristic 2013. Today, I’m concerned with Brian Moore’s 1972 novella, <cite>Catholics</cite>, published some seven years after the Second Vatican Council ended, but set in the aftermath of the (fictional) Fourth.</p><p>The exact date of the setting isn’t identified but it’s shortly before the end of the twentieth century. When James Kinsella lands on the island of Muck in a helicopter, the abbot of the island’s monastery tells him:</p><blockquote>“… that’s the first flying machine of any description that has ever landed on Muck. You’ve brought us the symbol of the century. Just when I thought we’d be able to close the hundred years out and say we’d missed our time.”</blockquote><p>Later, not long before Kinsella leaves the island, he responds to the abbot:</p><blockquote>“This is the end of the twentieth century, not the beginning of the thirteenth. How can we even define what heresy is today?”</blockquote><p>So, we seem to be in or around 1999. The novella dramatizes a conflict between personal faith and institutional loyalty, between conscience and the duty to obey. This kind of conflict has existed as long as people have had consciences and institutions. Moore’s exploration of the conflict isn’t particularly dramatic but it holds some surprises.</p><p>Some of the monks of Muck Abbey, on an inaccessible, storm-tossed island off the south-west coast of Ireland, have been crossing to the mainland every Sunday to say Mass in the traditional manner: in Latin, with the celebrant and congregation facing the same direction, and preceded by private, individual confession. The unapproved form of Mass becomes very popular, drawing large attendances from all over the world.</p><p>This causes embarrassment to the Vatican, which is engaged in ecumenical negotiations with Buddhism, so the father general of their order sends a troubleshooter whose task is to leave the abbot in no doubt that any continuation of these heterodox practices will not be tolerated. That the institution will win is all but inevitable. The abbot has the same rank as a bishop and can’t simply be told what to do by his provincial, but the father general has the right to transfer him to a very different office, and can put pressure on him by threatening to do so.</p><p>It’s usual in conflicts of this sort for author and reader alike to sympathize with the rebel cause. And these rebels are personally sympathetic. Father Manus is patently sincere and well intentioned when he defends the traditional Mass in Latin, leading the abbot to respond, “I wish I had all that fire and conviction, Manus”. Father Matthew, the “Master of novices with no novices to master”, is more confrontational but no less sincere in his convictions. Like Manus, he insists that the Mass and the consecration are a mystery and “a miracle”.</p><p>Kinsella, an American whose ancestors came from County Mayo, is the priest sent by the father general to sort out the problem. Before he leaves, he tells the father general that he visited Ireland once before, for the Yeats Summer School in Sligo. The father general quotes the penultimate line of “The Second Coming”:</p><blockquote>“‘What rough beast, its hour come round at last.’ Appropriate. I want you to bury this beast. And I think the way to do that is for me to give you plenipotentiary status. Emissaries who must report back to headquarters, especially young ones, would seem to these old mastodons to be mere novices …”</blockquote><p>As Kinsella goes to meet the abbot for the first time, there is an echo of the poem’s opening phrase:</p><blockquote>Kinsella, turning and turning in that cold stone turret to come out through the narrow door into the abbot’s parlor, was dizzying, confusing,  causing him, at first, to miss his host’s welcoming hand.</blockquote><p>Perhaps the second-best-known lines of the poem come at the end of the first verse paragraph:</p><blockquote>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>Are full of passionate intensity.</blockquote><p>These lines aren’t quoted in the novella but there’s little room for doubt that Moore had them in mind. There’s been some disagreement as to whether Yeats was attempting to describe a universal truth or merely commenting on the circumstances of that historical moment. <cite>The Irish Times</cite>’s <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/in-a-word-intensity-1.2371595\">Patsy McGarry favours the second alternative</a>. The quote, he says:</p><blockquote>… has been used again and again over the past century, or thereabouts, to give intensity a bad name. It’s as if some believe Yeats was promulgating a profound insight into the human condition, whereas he was just making an observation from a particular place and time.</blockquote><p>The particular place and time were the aftermath of the first world war in Europe, so he has a point. I’d find McGarry’s argument more convincing, though, if it didn’t focus solely on intensity but paid more attention to passion. It’s not intensity in itself that’s characteristic of “the worst”, but <em>passionate</em> intensity, that is to say an intensity that has a person in its grip and can’t be controlled.</p><p>The character in Moore’s novella who most obviously lacks all conviction is the abbot. He twice utters the phrase, “I am not a holy man”. The second time, he goes on to explain:</p><blockquote>“I am a sort of foreman here, a sort of manager. It’s not a lot different from a secular job. The monks work hard and my job is to keep them together and see that they make a go of it. It’s a simple life here. Little jokes, little triumphs, little disasters. We’re like a bunch of children, we pass the days as if we had an endless supply of them. It’s only when someone like yourself comes along that we ask ourselves what we are here for.”</blockquote><p>The abbot has long since given up praying. There had been times, culminating in a visit to Lourdes, when attempting to pray had brought on him a sense that he was entering a void, “the hell of no feeling”, which made him tremble unbearably. The prayers seemed false and without meaning. In Lourdes, he had protected himself from these feelings by shutting himself in his room for two days, claiming to have dysentery.</p><blockquote>So the abbot avoided prayer. One could pretend to a preference for private devotions. One’s Mass could be said alone. He no longer read his daily office. As for public prayers, in a community like this there were always others, greedy to lead. Sometimes, one had to say a grace. One said the words, but did not pray. If one did not risk invoking God, one did not risk one’s peace of mind. He was needed here. He did his work. He did his best. But did not pray.</blockquote><p>If the abbot is unwilling to end the Latin Mass and the private confessions, it is not on the grounds of belief or doctrine but rather because he feels a sense of responsibility for the wellbeing of the monks, like Manus and Matthew, for whom faith in the miracles of consecration and transubstantiation is the essence of their religion.</p><p>The abbot decides that his duty of obedience to the order and its father general must outweigh that responsibility to his subordinates. He writes a letter to the father general and assures Kinsella that he will give the order that in future Mass must be celebrated and confession heard in accordance with the approved rites. But he wants Kinsella to leave the island before he announces his decision to the monks:</p><blockquote>“You see, that will be the important part, how I break it to them. Some of them are very devout. They will take it hard. No, it will not be easy at all. To tell you the truth I am a bit nervous about it.”</blockquote><p>On first reading of the novella, I suspected that the abbot was playing some devious game. He would profess obedience to his superior and loudly proclaim the end of the outdated, traditional practices, while tacitly encouraging dissent and revolt among the monks. Surely, that was the point of his exchange with Father Matthew the night before Kinsella’s departure:</p><blockquote>“I am informed by Rome that the Mass is now merely symbolic. Do you understand what I am saying?”</blockquote><blockquote>“That is heresy, pure and simple!”</blockquote><p>And shortly afterwards:</p><blockquote>“Our visitor brings an order from our father general. Would you obey that order, Father Matthew, even if that order instructed you to consider the Mass not as a miracle, but, let’s say, just a pious ritual?”</blockquote><p>Kinsella believes that the Mass is no more than a pious ritual that doesn’t entail the real presence of God, and he assures the abbot that this is the belief of most modern Catholics. But it’s a misrepresentation  on the abbot’s part to suggest that the father general’s order requires the celebrant of the Mass to believe likewise. The order concerns the form of the ritual, not the priest’s state of mind. It doesn’t attempt to compel belief, or disbelief.</p><p>In other words, the abbot is presenting the situation to Father Matthew in the way that it least likely to be acceptable to him. Is he doing so to stir up dissent or merely to test the other man’s obedience? After Matthew has gone to bed, as he has been ordered to do, the abbot regrets his own “unruly temper”.</p><p>Once Kinsella has left in the helicopter, the abbot makes his decision known to the monks. As he expected, they take it hard.</p><blockquote>… he saw in those faces that he was failing, that he was losing them, that he must do something he had never done, give something he had never given in these, his years as their abbot. What had kept him in fear since Lourdes, must now be faced. What he feared most to do must be done. And if, in doing it, I enter null and never return, amen. My time has come.</blockquote><p>Telling them that “Prayer is the only miracle” and “If our words become prayer, God will come”, he kneels to lead them in the “Our Father”.</p><blockquote>His trembling increased. He entered null. He would never come back.</blockquote><p>So, the abbot was sincere in his professions of obedience after all. The ending of the novel is clearly based on a paradox: it is the man without faith who, to bring about a more secular Church where the traditional beliefs are no more than optional, who must sacrifice himself to “a sort of purgatory presaging the true hell to come”.</p><p>I don’t find the paradox wholly convincing; but arguably it’s in the nature of paradox to tend to undermine itself. Moore’s novella was certainly a more interesting and rewarding read than I feared it might be.</p>",

			"title": "Philip Kerr, A Philosophical Investigation (1992)",
			"content_html": "<img src=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/kerr-philosoph-investig.png\" alt=\"Cover image: A Philosophical Investigation, paperback\" width=\"640\" height=\"1024\" /><p>A few weeks ago, I reread Philip Kerr’s <cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite>, which I previously read in the summer of 1993. I remembered absolutely nothing about the novel except that it featured a serial killer named Wittgenstein. Even that solitary recollection was misleading: “Wittgenstein” was merely a secret codename, and the character was labelled a “multiple murderer”, or simply a “multiple”, not a serial killer. I might as well have been reading the novel for the first time.</p><p>In 1993 I hadn’t yet read Eliot’s “The Waste Land”, so I presumably overlooked the novel’s allusions to that poem, though I must have noticed those to “The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock”. Now that I recognize “The Waste Land” references I don’t know what to make of them. Some of them seem purely superficial: for example, one victim of a killer whose codename is Shakespeare is named Mary Woolnoth, another Jessie Weston. (Jessie L Weston wrote <cite>From Ritual to Romance</cite>, to which Eliot refers in the notes to “The Waste Land”.)</p><p>I suppose that the allusions are meant to suggest that the novel is set in a land that is sick and decaying because of the shortcomings of its ruler(s); I can’t see any more specific parallels. Eliot had such a different worldview from mine — he was a Christian who thought that human consciousness had changed after Donne, and that the early seventeenth century poet had “felt his thought as immediately as the odour of a rose” — that I long ago gave up any expectation of being able fully to appreciate his poetry.</p><p>At least Eliot’s poetry is familiar (though certainly not easy) territory to me; I’m quite incapable of saying what light is thrown on the novel by the philosophy of Wittgenstein. For one thing, I’ve never had the kind of mind that easily (or at all) gets to grips with philosophy. Even with Marx (whose <cite>Theses on Feuerbach</cite> would have provided the title to this note if I hadn’t decided on Empson’s “This Last Pain” instead) I’ve always found the economics easier to grasp and more compelling than the philosophy.</p><p>So, I read the novel feeling all the time that a substantial part of its significance was going right over my head. Unexpectedly, that was not at all an unpleasant feeling, though I don’t usually enjoy having my attention drawn to the gaps in my understanding. This note is evidence of my unwillingness to pass over in silence that of which I personally cannot speak (though others presumably could). Those others have been frustratingly reticent: though the novel is almost 30 years old, I haven’t been able to find any substantial discussion online of its “ideas”.</p><p>Detective Chief Inspector Isadora Jacowicz is in charge of a unit that investigates the murders of women, a crime of which there’s an epidemic in the London of 2013. (The novel is set 21 years in the future from when it was published in 1992. It’s been an eventful 21 years.) Jake, a specialist in gynocide, is put in charge of an investigation into the multiple murders of men — a much rarer crime.</p><p>It turns out that killer and victims alike have all been identified by the Lambroso project, in effect because of the shape of their brains, as having a particular propensity to violence. Men so identified are offered therapy and medication to control their violent tendencies, and their names are placed on a confidential database which flags them up if they should be involved in a violent crime, but not otherwise.</p><p>To the killer, codenamed Wittgenstein, it seems obvious that his murderous inclinations can best be put to use in eliminating the other men in the programme who share his own propensities. At least one of his targets, “Shakespeare”, really is a multiple murderer. Shakespeare notices that he is being followed and confronts Wittgenstein, frightening him off. Ironically, Shakespeare is later killed by Jake, who has shot low, aiming for his legs, and accidentally hit his femoral artery.</p><p>Against Jake’s protests, and under pressure from the Home Office, a Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge (best known for his detective novels featuring the investigations of Plato) tries to persuade Wittgenstein that the logic of his position should lead him to take his own life. This doesn’t immediately carry any weight with the killer, who can see that it’s an attempt to manipulate him; but he eventually comes to see the force of the argument. Jake doesn’t want Wittgenstein to kill himself; she’d prefer to arrest him and see him go on trial. On conviction (which is almost inevitable, given the evidence) the killer will be sentenced to indefinite Punitive Coma.</p><p>Jake does not herself approve of Punitive Coma:</p><blockquote>As punishments went it was worse than a long term of imprisonment and almost worse than death itself. But this is what happened when society had become morally squeamish about capital punishment and when prisons had become too overcrowded and expensive to be practical for any but minor offenders. (<cite>A Philosophical Investigation</cite>, Quercus Editions paperback, 2020, p. 302)</blockquote><p>Punitive Coma is not necessarily final, at least in theory. A Home Office minister tells journalists:</p><blockquote>And the best argument of all for PC as the law’s ultimate sanction is that, where mistakes are made — and let’s face it, any system is fallible — a sentence can be reversed. (p. 495)</blockquote><p>Of course, someone in a coma is no more likely than someone in a grave to be preparing an appeal or a petition for clemency, or instructing lawyers, so the “best argument” for Punitive Coma is moot. Anybody facing the procedure will know that it’s overwhelmingly unlikely that he or she will ever emerge from it, and that there’s no guarantee that he or she won’t feel anything while in that state, waiting for the end.</p><p>Jake examines one of the drawers, “slightly larger than a coffin”, in which comatose convicts were to be stored:</p><blockquote>The bottom of the drawer was upholstered in soft black calf leather, which was the only concession made to the prevention of pressure sores. A number of tubes and catheters, which would be attached to the convict’s body, protruded from the drawer’s sides. (p. 489)</blockquote><p>Jake’s determination to prevent Wittgenstein’s suicide and instead to play her part in delivering him to this fate might therefore look more like vindictiveness than a simple wish to do her duty. In fact, the book is rather more ambiguous about Jake’s intentions and motivations than this suggests. There’s an implication that her accidental killing of Shakespeare might have satified her previously thwarted desire to kill her brutal father. There are other indications that what Jake feels towards Wittgenstein at the end is closer to sympathy than a thirst for retribution.</p><p>When he talks about the restoration “of moral order to a world that was temporarily upset by my crimes”, she answers:</p><blockquote>”Any restoration such as you describe would be an illusion, in my opinion,” she said … If I have any explanation at all, it’s that you can no longer distinguish between what is real and what is unreal. But that doesn’t make you so very different from a lot of other people. Nobody cares much for reality any more … Is that what you would call a moral order? If you ask me, there’s not much balance around anywhere. And this — this investigation was just a holding action.” (pp. 503–04, ellipses added)</blockquote><p>Is that what makes this story a <em>philosophical</em> investigation, in contrast with the traditional fictional investigation whose function is to restore order to the world? That explanation is good enough for me.</p>",

			"title": "I’m again thinking of leaving Medium",
			"content_html": "<p>Four months ago, I was about to delete my Medium account. I’d moved a lot of my less ephemeral posts from there to this site: <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html\">my fiction</a>, my <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss\">book discussion</a> posts and a dozen or so <a href=\"https://blog.artkavanagh.ie/miscellaneous-posts-that-i-moved-from-medium-656d1b0521c0\">miscellaneous bits and pieces</a>. The main things left to move were my posts on the topics of <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html\">aphantasia and severely deficient autobiograpical memory (SDAM)</a>. And then I had second thoughts: it struck me that it would be easier, as well as better for my search engine visibility, if I left the posts where they were and simply pointed a subdomain of artkavanagh.ie at them. This had become possible when <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/custom-domains-are-back-2dee29560d59\">Medium reintroduced custom domain names</a>, a feature that they had discontinued a few years ago.</p><p>Custom domains are available to anyone who pays Medium’s subscription fee of $5 a month. I had stopped paying it in June 2019 but was happy to resume my membership so I could use my own domain name and incidentally (I hoped) to get better recommendations on my home page. For most of the previous two years, I’d been reading for the most part posts which weren’t behind the paywall. If I began to read more widely on Medium, I reasoned, the algorithm would get a better sense of what I liked, and show me more of it.</p><p>Four months on, I think it may be the moment to call time on that experiment. While $5 a month isn’t a lot of money, I could easily find something more useful to spend it on. Much of what appears in my Medium timeline is of very little interest to me. More to the point, my recommendations don’t seem to have improved as I had hoped. Medium has made some recent changes designed to make it easier to find posts that appeal to me — just a few days ago, they made it possible to <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/expanding-topics-to-be-more-personalized-eec1f19307e\">follow tags</a> (which may be user-defined) rather than a limited number of predefined topics. But this change may have come too late for me. Too much of what I’ve been seeing on Medium recently has been insubstantial, disposable “content”.</p><p>Also, counterintuitively, I have the impression that much of the most valuable writing on the platform isn’t behind the paywall. Its authors post only occasionally, when they have something significant to say, so there’s no reason for them to join the Partner Program, where frequent posting is the way to get noticed. So, it looks as if I’m going to be letting my Medium membership lapse again. With it will go my <strong>blog.artkavanagh.ie</strong> subdomain. I don’t think it will be any great loss.</p><p>I’ve recently been seeing a lot of Medium writers complaining that their page views and reads have dropped off dramatically. They’re mostly talking about their internal views, i.e. those coming from within Medium itself. My views have always tended more to come from outside (primarily from Google) but I too have noticed a precipitous drop. I wondered if this was because blog.artkavanagh.ie was less visible or trustworthy than artkavanagh.medium.com but this doesn’t seem to be the case. When I Google key terms for some of my recent posts, those posts tend to come about as high in the search results as I’d have expected when I was using the Medium domain.</p><p>If I’m going to be losing the custom domain on Medium, it makes sense  to revert to the plan I had four months ago, and move everything worth keeping, including the aphantasia/SDAM posts, to this site. I’ll be doing that over the next 6 to 8 weeks. Posting here rather than on Medium will give me more control over the look and feel as well as allowing me to use <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/cite-markup.html\">a wider range of html elements than are available on Medium</a>. Once everything has been moved, I’ll delete my Medium account, as I had been intending to do in May. Apart from anything else, it will be easier to keep track of my posts if they’re all in one place.</p>",

			"title": "Paul Graham and the online essay",
			"content_html": "<p>I read Paul Graham’s recent essay, <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/worked.html\">What I worked on</a>, because someone tweeted a longish quote from it including this paragraph:</p><blockquote>It’s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it’s a sign both that there’s something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren’t prestigious doesn’t guarantee you’re on the right track, it at least guarantees you’re not on the most common type of wrong one.</blockquote><p>I found that the essay contains a lot more than that nugget of wisdom. The whole piece is a personal memoir of — the title’s a bit of a giveaway — the things he’s worked on in the course of his career. Those things include the origins of “Software as a service” (SaaS), Lisp (which he describes as “a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself”) and an approach to funding startups that doesn’t mean gigantic investments of venture capital right from the start. He studied painting in Florence and RISD, and spent substantial periods working on still life paintings.</p><p>His essay reads in part like a history of tech startup culture, something that isn’t necessarily going to appeal to everyone. Graham makes it interesting because he has an idiosyncratic way of looking at things. (That passage about working on unregarded projects is a good example.) He’s highly intelligent and perceptive and has a knack for seeing a problem or situation from an unexpected angle. His work as cofounder of Y Combinator came about, not because he particularly wanted to mentor and fund startups, but because he believed “that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they'd be sources of advice too”.</p><p>It’s worth noting in passing that, while Graham is an impressive writer and thinker, it doesn’t follow that these qualities will necessarily lead to benign results. Y Combinator’s two greatest successes have been AirBnB and Dropbox, neither of which I consider a net benefit to the world.</p><p>In cities like Dublin, the effect of AirBnB has been to restrict the supply of residential property available for longer term letting, and  therefore driving rents up to unaffordable levels.</p><p>I know many people who use Dropbox all the time and who can’t imagine being without it. I’ve been suspicious of it since reading a few stories like <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/09/20/dropbox-macos-security\">this one from Daring Fireball</a>. Perhaps I’m being unnecessarily suspicious but I’m going to continue to avoid it.</p><p>The main thing I’ll take away from the essay might well be the word “essay” itself. Around 2001, Graham posted something on his website, paulgraham.com, “which I’d created years before … but never used for anything”. It was a talk he’d given about Lisp at a conference. Somebody linked to it on Slashdot and he got 30,000 page views in a day.</p><blockquote>Wow, I thought, there’s an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. …</blockquote><blockquote>This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/essay.html\">essays</a>.</blockquote><p>He concluded:</p><blockquote>I’ve worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I’d always write essays too.</blockquote><p>It was that recognition that led to his observation about the value of working on things that aren’t prestigious: “I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I’m writing, and I explain that  it’s an essay I’m going to publish on my web site.”</p><p>Since I started to post more writing online about 4 years ago, I’ve been self-conscious about not being quite sure what to call it. “Posts” seems to come naturally but it’s easy to overuse, and then what’s the appropriate verb? “I posted a post” won’t really do. “I wrote a post” is OK, and I suppose the noun implies that I didn’t <em>just</em> write it but put it online also. Another term I’m perhaps too fond of it “piece”: I wonder if it sounds affected, as if I’m pretending to be a journalist? I very occasionally use “article” but I think it applies better to a piece that appears in a journal or magazine. So, I’m grateful to Paul Graham for reminding me about “essays”.</p><p>It’s not a term that I had previously associated with the web or the internet. Essays, surely, belonged in dusty, leather-bound volumes by Hazlitt or Carlyle. But it seems they can also be found on Paul Graham’s website.</p><p>I’ve been finding it easy to write something quick and disposable on a topic I’ve got a bee in my bonnet about: something like the future of search or of the web, the relative merits of Markdown and LaTeX, or of HTML and RSS, or ePub and PDF. This feels satisfying, and it’s obviously “writing”, but then I notice that months have gone by and I haven’t written anything about Andrew Marvell, who is supposed to be my principal subject.</p><p>I had been a bit puzzled by my decision to send out a newsletter on Substack</a>, when I’ve said in the past that I consider email an out-of-date technology and a poor alternative to RSS or the web. It was only after I read Graham’s encomium to the essay that I realized that I chose to write a newsletter not because I like the medium of distribution but because it gives me the opportunity to write longer, more discursive and (I hope) more considered pieces that are in some sense walled off from less weighty and more ephemeral posts. So, <a href=\"https://talkaboutbooks.substack.com\">Talk about books</a> is my commitment to write a regular essay on a bookish or literary topic. It’s a relief as well as a surprise to have figured out, three and a half months in, what I’m doing with it.</p>",

This has meant that over the past three weeks, I’ve been consulting both books extensively. I have both an ebook and a paperback copy of the first book. I originally read <cite>In the Woods</cite> in Apple Books (probably when it was still known as iBooks) on my iPad. Then I found a copy of the paperback on sale, so I bought it for future reference. I’ve since read the paperback twice.</p><p>When writing the piece for the newsletter, if I wanted to quote or refer to a passage from <cite>In the Woods</cite>, I’d often search for it in the ebook, note the chapter, and then find the passage in the paperback so that I could refer to the printed page number. In doing this, I noticed another way in which the ebook is different from, and less satisfactory than, the printed version.</p><p>At many points, a change of scene or topic is marked by extra space at the start of a paragraph. Such paragraphs don’t have an indent as regular paragraphs do. Here’s an example:</p><img src=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/in-the-woods-printed.jpg\" alt=\"Page from paperback edition\" width=\"640\" height=\"1022\"><p>In the ebook, however, these paragraphs don’t have any additional space before them.

			"title": "Citing book and journal titles on Medium and Substack",
			"content_html": "<p>I haven’t been posting much on Medium in the last two years because most of what I write has been coming here to this site. Then, at the end of November 2020, I started a Substack newsletter and that’s been taking most of my attention for the last 10 weeks or so, with the result that I haven’t been posting much here either.</p><p>Writing in the Substack editor had reminded me of something that used to bother me a bit about Medium. It’s not a major issue but it tends to niggle a bit. On both platforms, when you make text italic, it’s marked up with an \u0026lt;em\u0026gt; inline element in HTML. The purpose of that element is to indicate <em>emphasis</em>. The problem for me is that emphasis isn’t the only reason I might want to italicize some text. In fact, since I often write about books, I probably use italics more often to denote the title of a book or periodical. When I’m writing HTML (as I do on this site) the solution is easy: instead of using \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;, I enclose the title in \u0026lt;cite\u0026gt; … \u0026lt;/cite\u0026gt; tags. The presentation is indistinguishable — the text is italicized in both cases — but the semantics are different. </p><p>Unfortunately, neither Medium nor Substack makes it possible to use the \u0026lt;cite\u0026gt; element. If I want inline italics, it’s \u0026lt;em\u0026gt; or nothing; so up to now I’ve been <em>emphasizing</em> book titles for want of a better approach. When I removed a lot of my posts and stories from Medium and posted them on this site instead, I had to go through them, replacing most (though unfortunately not all) of the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt; tags with \u0026lt;cite\u0026gt; ones. I find it curious, given the current general enthusiasm for semantic HTML, that both Medium and Substack restrict the use of italics in this way. I suppose that they want to include all the available options in a toolbar, without making that toolbar too unwieldy.</p><p>At the weekend, I sent out my newsletter, which refers to the titles of two novels (emphasized, as usual). Then, a bit later, I was writing something to post on Medium, marking the newsletter’s 10 weeks of existence. That post contained several titles and I was getting less and less comfortable knowing that each of those titles was encased in \u0026lt;em\u0026gt; tags although I had no wish to emphasize them. I wondered whether there might not be another way.</p><p>A few months ago, I wrote a post, <a href=\"https://www.artkavanagh.ie/even-plainer-text.html\">Even plainer text</a>, in which I suggested an approach to writing a structured document (including title, two levels of heading, block quotes etc.) using UTF-8 only and without reference to an external (or embedded) style sheet. UTF-8 makes it possible to write most of what you need in a text editor: accented characters, dashes, curly quotes, em and en spaces, ellipses and much more. What you can’t do, however, is change the font, or make text bold or italic, so I suggested a few workarounds. This is what I had to say about the \u0026lt;cite\u0026gt; element:</p><blockquote>There’s no way to avoid some markup for this one, I’m afraid: I suggest using braces (curly brackets) as in Henry Fielding, {The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling} or {The New Yorker}</blockquote><p>But then it crossed my mind that a more satisfactory approach might be to use emoji, which can be included in a “plain text” file and displayed in a text editor. My idea was that, instead of using braces, you might write “Henry Fielding, The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling📖”.</p><p>The alternative that I considered was making every book or periodical title a link to information about the book (perhaps on the publisher’s site) or to the publication itself, like this: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/297400/the-history-of-tom-jones-a-foundling-by-henry-fielding/\">The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling</a> or <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com\">The New Yorker</a>. That way, the title would be marked up as a link and would be easily distinguishable from the surrounding text, but without being misleadingly presented as emphasis.</p><p>In principle, I prefer the emoji approach because I’m trying to keep the number of links to a minimum. If a book is mentioned several times in a piece, I don’t think it would be a good idea to make each instance of the title a link! Also, not all links would be titles, so using links to indicate titles might be a bit confusing. On the other hand, the emoji may be more distracting to a reader.</p><p>I’m pleased to cut down on my use of italics because I prefer a sans serif font, and many of those don’t have real italics, but use <em>slanted</em> letters instead. (Two sans fonts which <em>do</em> have italics, and which I like, are Trebuchet MS and Myriad; but neither of them can be used on Medium or Substack.)</p><p>So, for now, I’m trying out emoji. Here is <a href=\"https://artkavanagh.medium.com/talk-about-books-newsletter-b7af884a7253\">the Medium post, mentioned above, that I was working on</a> when the question crossed my mind. I’d be interested to hear whether readers think this kind of markup-with-emoji is useful, or is it merely annoying?</p><p>A third possibility has now occurred to me, which is to make the title a link the first time it occurs, and subsequently to render it as normal, unitalicized text. Leave it to the reader to figure out, from the context, whether (upright) “Tom Jones” refers to the novel or to its protagonist. That may impose less cognitive load than asking her to make sense of emoji. Maybe that’s what I’ll try next.</p>",

I was wondering if SDAM might affect one’s ability to recognize or remember the feelings associated with rewards, so I Googled “severely deficient autobiographical memory” and “dopamine”. What I found was not at all what I was expecting. It was <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02211-5\">this article</a> from <cite>Nature</cite>, suggesting that dopamine is of vital importance to our ability to forget.</p><p>That’s an interesting topic that I may well come back to in a future post. But for now, I just want to note this paragraph, which is of tangential relevance to the main point of the article, and to the topic of my search, but is of obvious interest to anyone who has SDAM:</p><blockquote>Those with severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM), however, are unable to vividly recall specific events in their lives. As a result, they also have trouble imagining what might happen in the future. Yet in Levine’s experience, people with SDAM tend to do particularly well in jobs that require abstract thinking — probably because they are not weighed down by the nitty-gritty. “We think SDAM people, through a lifetime of practice of not having episodic memory, have an ability to cut across episodes,” Levine says. “They’re good at solving problems.”</blockquote><p>Since discovering that I have SDAM, I’ve been inclined to think of it as a disadvantage, though a mild one. I mean, when the term begins “severely deficient …” it kind of nudges you in that direction, don’t you think? But it’s important to recognize that people who have SDAM have strengths as well as weaknesses in comparison with people with normal episodic memories. We tend to be good at abstract thought — something I’ve long recognized about myself, before I ever suspected that I have SDAM — and at avoiding getting caught up in the details of episodic memories. </p><p>I’ve been regularly saying to myself since I found out that I have aphantasia and SDAM that I need to learn to “play to my strengths”. Perhaps I haven’t had a clear enough idea of what those strengths are.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>In or about 1991, the playwright David Hare caused a commotion on BBC2’s arts show with his assertion that too many critics and cultural commentators knew how to sneer but didn’t know how to judge. They could appear “critical” by finding some weakness or infelicity in any given book, play, film, dance performance or piece of music, but they either weren’t equipped or simply weren’t willing to arrive at an assessment of the worth of the work in question: whether it was significant; whether its effects on society, a community or the spectators’s spirits were good or bad; how it should be evaluated. In the end, the prolific sneering was not supported by any system of values. According to Hare, if you wanted to be a serious critic, you had to be willing to say that Keats was better than Bob Dylan.</p><p>This provoked a response, of course, but it was a response that missed Hare’s point. “<em>Is</em> Keats better than Dylan?” the critics asked, some with a sneer, others presumably suppressing one. But I don’t remember hearing any of them address the more general question of <em>judgment</em>, which had been the one animating the playwright. The Dylan/Keats juxtaposition was merely an illustrative example, but that was what the responders latched onto. In taking such care to avoid Hare’s main point, the critics seemed to be making it for him.</p><p>I was firmly on Hare’s side, and excited to hear him articulate so clearly what had been my own uncrystallized opinion. At the time I was still very left-wing, and Hare had a reputation as a theatrical revolutionary. I hadn’t really liked what I’d seen (or, before my arrival in London three years earlier, read) of his plays. But his views on criticism were reassuringly close to my own.</p><p>Of course, the obvious thing about judgment is that it can’t be arbitrary. You have to judge according to a standard or a yardstick: a set of conditions or values. For me, with my political views at that time, the selection of an appropriate yardstick was straightforward: any work was to be judged by the extent to which it either shored up or undermined the capitalist basis of the society in which it was produced. Was its effect, objectively viewed, progressive; or was it reactionary or conservative?</p><p>The fervour of my socialist convictions lasted barely another two years following the Hare broadcast. I’ve written before that when you change a fundamental belief your other opinions, including those founded on nothing more solid than the one you’ve just abandoned, don’t automatically get replaced by something more consonant with your revised philosophy. My insistence on the importance of critical judgment survived the change in my politics. In fact, the connection between the two has been invisible to me: it’s only now, in starting to write this post, that I see where the commitment to judgment originally came from.</p><p>Also around 2 years after Hare’s appearance on <cite>The Late Show</cite>, I went back to university and, in my 30s, began to study for a BA in English literature. One of the first-year courses was an introduction to literary theory given by Len Jackson (author of the three books in Longman’s series “Foundations of modern literary theory”). In an early lecture, Len said that there are essentially three ways of writing about literature: theory, criticism and scholarship. Of the three, I was immediately sure that the one that appealed to me was criticism.</p><p>Theory at the time was dominated by disciples of Foucault, Derrida and similar paradoxical thinkers. I’d already read enough of this to know it wasn’t a path I wanted to follow. I retained enough of my former Marxism to recognize a type of discourse that sounded “radical”, while at the same time purporting to demonstrate the futility of trying to alter actual social relations. It seemed designed (though I’m sure most of its proponents weren’t conscious of its objective effects) to provide students (and still more so their lecturers) with an outlet for their rebellious aspirations without posing a threat to anything of consequence. The only venerable institutions at risk were reading-lists full of dead, white, European males.</p><p>Scholarship, in contrast to theory, was admirable, easily undervalued and utterly essential to the whole process of writing about literature. I thought of it as a kind of self-sacrifice, whose practitioners set about reading the boring stuff: contemporary newspapers and pamphlets, public records, personal correspondence and other unexciting material. They held back from reading “the works themselves”, in order to make it easier for <em>other</em> people to enjoy them without making egregious historical and contextual errors. Scholarship was the foundation without which the elaborate theoretical and critical structures would collapse.</p><p>As for me, there was no doubt in my mind that what I wanted to do was focus on “the works themselves”. It now seems to me that I must have made a tacit deal with myself according to which, to justify such self-indulgence, I should have to perform important work of judgment and evaluation.</p><p>So, I’ve believed for at least 30 years that the paramount responsibility of the literary critic is judgment. That’s not as straightforward or simple a belief as it sounds. As I said before, to judge you need a yardstick or set of standards, and I had quickly discarded those I started out with. I wasn’t finding it easy to replace them. The problem is that you can’t use a yardstick or standards that are too fixed or inflexible, otherwise you risk approaching each work with your mind already made up. I concluded that this trap could be avoided only by treating each work as containing — indeed as constituting — its own key. You learn how to interpret (and judge) each book (or poem, play etc) by reading that book, poem or play itself (or by seeing the play in performance). To put it another way, in reading a book, ideally you will be reevaluating what you’ve already read and are continuing to read, in the light of what you’re reading, as you’re reading it. That’s one of the reasons I think rereading is so important.</p><p>To be clear, none of this is to claim that I’ve been consistently exercising critical judgment towards everything I’ve read in various genres, styles and forms, over the years since I enrolled for the BA. But I was convinced that, ideally, that’s what I <em>ought to have been</em> doing. Whenever I wrote a book review, or a blog post about a book, or an essay for an academic journal, this sense that I really should be assessing the work by exercising objective, rational judgment, was always present as a kind of lodestone, trying to draw my writing in a particular direction.</p><p>Until the week before last. Then, <cite>The Observer</cite>’s long-standing information technology columnist, John Naughton, posted on his blog <a href=\"https://memex.naughtons.org/saturday-14-november-2020/32002/\">a quote from Robert Musil</a>:</p><blockquote>Only in the most unusual cases is it useful to determine whether a book is good or bad. It is usually both.</blockquote><p>This is from Musil’s <cite>Precision and Soul: Essays and addresses</cite>. It was unfamiliar to me. It states an obvious, uncomplicated truth, one that I find it hard to believe I’ve overlooked for so many years. Most of us, most of the time, don’t read a book in order to judge it. We read it perhaps to learn something, to find a piece of information, to prepare an argument, speech or essay. We may read it for entertainment, to pass the time or to exercise some faculty of our brain. Ultimately, a lot of reading is done primarily for pleasure of one sort or another. Sometimes, but certainly not always, judgment is desirable or unavoidable.</p><p>Sometimes, on the other hand, judgment is just too easy: a way to preempt ostensibly less important but more interesting questions. Many years ago, I came across a truly atrocious paragraph in Timothy Mo’s <cite>The Redundancy of Courage</cite>. I no longer remember any detail about it except that it was the last paragraph on a recto some way into the book. I finished that book but felt absolved from ever again having to read anything by Timothy Mo, and I’ve taken full advantage of that dispensation.</p><p>Something similar happened around the same time, when I was reading <cite>The Book of Evidence</cite> by John Banville. The novel centres on a violent murderer, who is eventually arrested and brought before the District Court. His senior counsel (SC) makes an application for bail, which is immediately refused. It couldn’t have been granted. Only the High Court has (and then had) jurisdiction to allow bail on a murder charge, something an SC appearing in those circumstances would certainly know. (Senior counsel were rare in the District Court, tending to appear only in cases of murder or drunken driving.)</p><p>Reading that passage, I no longer felt I was in the hands of an author I could trust. In this case, too, I finished the book but I haven’t read anything else by John Banville, whether published before or after <cite>The Book of Evidence</cite>. I suspect that the losses have been mine rather than Banville’s or Mo’s. Till now, I’ve been happy to live with that.</p><p>Prompted by that brief quote from Robert Musil, I’ve decided to change my critical (and reading) practice. From now on, I’m going to try to read books (and plays, and poetry, and web pages, and whatever else) for whatever they might have to offer, and not with a constant eye to what I think is the value of the work. “Whatever they might have to offer” covers a wide variety of possibilities, not all equally worthwhile, and I’ll try not to be narrow in my expectations. I’m not sure what that will mean in practice: I want to be more open to what I read; and it’s not possible to be “open” while laying down in advance too rigid a set of criteria. My change of attitude might not make any appreciable difference, either to what I take from my reading or to how I write about it. It will be interesting to find out.</p><p>I’ve never read anything by Robert Musil. As a teenager, I was attracted by the cover art and the description on the back of the Picador edition of <cite>The Man without Qualities</cite>, but put off by the book’s length and the fact that he had never finished it. Decades later, I still haven’t read it. Maybe I should.</p>",

			"content_html": "<p>When I decided consciously to continue the boycott of Amazon that I had drifted into without noticing, part of my reason was anger at what the online retailer was doing to booksellers, independent and conglomerate alike. Amazon is one of the main factors driving bookshops out of business. Is the drawn-out but apparently inevitable disappearance of those booksellers regrettable? I’ll admit that, in answering that question to my own satisfaction, I may not have been entirely consistent.</p><p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve resisted the idea that it’s an ethical duty to favour small, independent, local businesses, such as corner shops, family-run operations or the self-employed entrepreneur, over large corporations, chains, multinational enterprises and retail giants. If we have no choice but to live in a capitalist economy, then why shouldn’t we take the benefits of capitalism — economies of scale, minuscule profit margins, price competition, customer service — along with the uglier essential features of the system: exploitation, low wages, long working hours and unfulfillable lives?</p><p>One might be personally sympathetic to the small business-owner, the corner grocer or the individual craft-worker, but sympathy can’t change the fact that the current of capitalist economic development is against them, and will remain so as long as we retain an economic system grounded on private ownership of capital. We might expect things to be different after the revolution — but the revolution still seems a long way off. In the meantime, why favour a shop assistant in the next street over a factory worker on a different continent? Can mere proximity make one more deserving of the insignificant effect of my purchasing power than the other?</p><p>Buying books is an actvity of a different kind from stocking up on groceries or household items. Or at least it was until Amazon came along. The main reason why I’d tend to buy my everyday essentials in a chain supermarket in preference to Henry’s Corner Shop is that I could expect them to be noticeably cheaper in the former. But there was never much price variation between <a href=\"http://www.stokenewingtonbookshop.co.uk\">the Stoke Newington Bookshop</a> on the one hand and Waterstones or <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/closing-down-sale-begins-books-etc\">Books etc</a> on the other. If I went to the bigger outlet first, it wasn’t because I was hoping for a bargain, but because there was a better chance their more extensive stock would include the book I was looking for. On the less frequent occasions I went to Stoke Newington, it was primarily to browse, not intending to buy a specific book.</p><p>Competition held the independents’ prices at a level comparable to the larger sellers, so price wasn’t a reason to prefer the latter to the former. Amazon changed that. It had the resources to discount books more deeply than either the chains or the independents were willing or able to go. And I, among millions of others, took the bait. I began to buy most of my books from Amazon (who not only offered the lowest price but could supply any title quicker than it could be ordered through even the largest chain stores) particularly after I moved to France in 2005/6. It was much cheaper to order English language books from Amazon.co.uk than from any French site, including Amazon.fr so that’s exactly what I did.</p><p>Around the same time as I moved, the economist Tyler Cowen wrote an essay, “What are independent bookstores really good for?” for <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2006/05/the-death-of-the-independent-bookstore.html\">Slate</a>, in which he argued that independent bookstores were not fulfilling a particularly useful function and that their decline in the face of competition from the likes of Barnes \u0026 Noble and Borders was not something to be particularly lamented. Typically, the independents don’t provide any greater literary or specialist expertise than a chain store, their main advantage for the reader or browser is that they may confer the appearance of hipness, of being “more literary or more offbeat” than the norm, and they will usually carry a more limited stock than the larger bookseller. </p><blockquote>But when it comes to providing simple access to the products you want, the superstores often do a better job of it than the small stores do: Borders and Barnes \u0026 Noble negotiate bigger discounts from publishers and have superior computer-driven inventory systems. The superstores’ scale allows them to carry many more titles, usually several times more, than do most of the independents; so if you’re looking for Arabic poetry you have a better chance of finding it at Barnes \u0026 Noble than at your local community bookstore.</blockquote><p>So, if Cowen was right, maybe I should be no more concerned about the threat to the survival of the independent bookseller than about the economic troubles of the newsagent down the street? At the time, I would have believed that. If I had read Cowen’s short essay when it first appeared or in the next few years, I’d quite likely have nodded my head in firm agreement. I hadn’t yet realized just how destructive a force Amazon had become.</p><p>Barely 5 years after Cowen’s piece was published, Borders had closed forever. Barnes \u0026 Noble seems to have <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2019/06/06/rumor-barnes-noble-to-be-acquired-by-the-hedge-fund-that-owns-waterstones/\">struggled for several years before it was acquired by Elliott Management</a> in 2019 and brought under the control of Waterstone’s CEO. I’ve seen some speculation (such as <a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/independent-bookstores-doing-better-than-ever-in-2012/\">this post from Melville House in 2013</a>) that independent booksellers have been better able to withstand the Amazon onslaught than the big chains. Of course, it may just be that the tribulations of the independents are less visible. It’s easy for the collapse or protracted insolvency of a small outlet to pass unnoticed. In any case, that was before the pandemic hit. The <cite>New York Times</cite> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/books/independent-bookstores-economy.html\">reports</a>:</p><blockquote>According to the American Booksellers Association … more than one independent bookstore has closed each week since the pandemic began. Many of those still standing are staring down the crucial holiday season and seeing a toxic mix of higher expenses, lower sales and enormous uncertainty.</blockquote><p><cite>Vox</cite>, too, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/10/25/21517545/bookstores-pandemic-booksellers-closing\">cites the ABA</a>, who say that 20% of independent bookstores across the United States are “in danger of closing”.</p><p>If huge operations like Borders and Barnes \u0026 Noble are vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the book economy, including Amazon’s predatory practices, then we need to decide whether we’re prepared to live in a world where the only substantial supplier of books is a monopolistic universal retailer who finds it more appealing to “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/books/independent-bookstores-economy.html\">colonize the moon</a>” than to cater to readers. If we aren’t happy to live in that world, independent booksellers now appear to be the only kind of enterprise capable of providing an alternative. We need to keep them in business.</p><p>Tyler Cowen may have had a good argument against indie bookstores in 2006, but the world, and the market for books, are unrecognizable now, compared with what he could have foreseen then. No doubt I’ll still buy books from Waterstones and Hodges Figgis; maybe even Easons, if I’m in a branch and they have a book I’ve been looking for. But I’ll also be making more of an effort to support my local bookshops. It’s a question of survival and not just for them but for an essential part of our culture.</p>",
