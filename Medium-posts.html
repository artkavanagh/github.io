<h1>Some of my posts on Medium</h1>

<p class="intro">This list is somewhat out of date. The links below were originally all to posts on Medium. I subsequently moved them to this site because I was intending to delete my Medium profile. Shortly before I did so, Medium reintroduced the use of custom domains, so I changed my mind and stayed on Medium, but this time using <a href="https://blog.artkavanagh.ie/">my own domain name</a>. However, it didn’t seem worthwhile to move these posts back to Medium, so they’ve remain on this site. I’ve amended the links below so that they now point to the current URLs, not the original Medium ones, and I’ve removed two links to posts that have been overtaken by events. Sorry if that’s a bit confusing.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 2018, I finally did something I’d been thinking about, on and off, for 20 years: I registered an .ie (Irish) domain name. Throughout 2017 and most of 2018, I had been posting most of my writing, fiction and non, on Medium. At first I wasn’t sure how I was going to divide my sparse output between my own site and Medium but it eventually settled into a pattern.</p>

<p>My posts on Medium had tended to fall into one of three general categories. First there was the fiction, mostly short but including one novel-length story and a novella. Then, from April 2018, there was a series of posts on the subject of aphantasia (the lack of a visual imagination, or the inability to form mental images), which I learned in my late 50s that I’ve had all my life). And finally, there was my critical book discussion, in which I took a look in greater depth than a typical review at anything from Nelson DeMille’s mystery <cite>The General’s Daughter</cite> to the poetry of William Empson and Andrew Marvell, by way of Kazuo Ishiguro’s <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite>. I’ve treated each of these three categories slightly differently.</p>

<p>I’ve now moved most of <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/fiction-list.html">the fiction</a> to this site. The exceptions are the novel (which I’m in the course of moving now) and a three-part story I’m not sure about and that I may decide to rewrite substantially. The aphantasia posts, in contrast, remain on Medium where they’re still attracting readers. Instead of moving them, I’ve created <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/aphantasia-posts.html">a page on this site which lists them all</a>, and to which each of them links back. As for <a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/index.html#bookdiscuss">the book discussion</a>, I’ve left most of the posts that were originally on Medium where they are, and put the more recent ones here.</p>

<p>That leaves those posts on Medium that don’t fit into any of these three categories. There are about 16 of these that I think are worth keeping, and I’ve listed them below in reverse chronological order.</p>

What did Colm Tóibín actually say about genre fiction — and what did he mean by it? Is it possible that some Irish crime fiction authors may have been too defensive in their responses?</li>

<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/ebooks-not-real">Why ebooks aren’t real books</a> &mdash; publishing<br>
The limitations of ebooks &mdash; most of them arbitrarily imposed, but some inherent in the nature of the format &mdash; make them an inferior reading experience to printed books.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/eluding-the-algorithm.html">Eluding the algorithm</a> &mdash; search and discovery<br>
Algorithmic search is really just a form of recommendation engine. We need better ways of finding things that interest us on the internet.</li>

If you’re a writer, the most important component (hardware or soft) of any computer you’ll ever use is the keyboard</li>

Some do it before they write a word, others do it all mixed up in the process of writing. Sophie Hannah is clearly one of the former. But there’s not as big a difference between the two types as you might think.</li>

<li>Thanks Twitter, it’s been fun &mdash; social media<br>I deleted my Twitter account after 9 years. it was easier than I had expected. — I’ve removed this post and I’m now <a href="https://blog.artkavanagh.ie/back-on-twitter-93703cb8fd07">Back on Twitter</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/novelette-form.html">Novelette: a suitable form for crime fiction?</a> &mdash; writing and publishing<br>
Revolutionary changes in publishing are making shorter forms of fiction more viable. But “shorter forms” doesn’t just mean short stories. We should be starting to see a greater flexibility as to story lengths.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.artkavanagh.ie/xmedium/uncollected-short-stories.html">Uncollected short stories</a> &mdash; writing and publishing<br>Publishers and readers have been wary of short stories because economics have dictated that they be published in collections the approximate length of a novel. The changes in publishing may make it easier to present them in a more appealing form.</li>

The two don’t usually mix well, except in the controlled conditions of public readings and conferences.</li>

If Wattpad has an advantage over Medium for the fiction writer, it’s in the way it makes it easy to post multipart stories. But it can be done just as well on Medium with just a little extra work. This is how.</li>
