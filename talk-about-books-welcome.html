<h1><a href="https://letter.talkaboutbooks.net/">Talk about books</a></h1>
<p>A fortnightly newsletter by Art Kavanagh about things I’ve read</p>
<p class="issueno">No. 1; 22 November 2020</p>

<h1>Welcome to Talk about books</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Thanks for checking this out.</p>
<p>I intend to send this newsletter out every 2 weeks, and that it will contain writing about the books I’ve been reading. Not book reviews, but a discussion in slightly more depth, of books that often won’t be new. Ideally, they’ll be books that you’ve read too. I’d like to get some kind of discussion going, like a book club.</p>
<p>Since I want to go into things in more depth than a standard book review, I will not be making any attempt to avoid giving away plot points. In other words, it’s quite likely that there’ll be spoilers (a word I try to avoid because I think it’s misleading). Don’t worry about them. If you haven’t yet read the book, you’ll quite likely have forgotten them by the time you get around to it — and in some cases, the (so called) spoiler may be what brings you to the book in the first place.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what to expect, here are links to some pieces I’ve already posted: roughly the same kind of thing as I intend to include in the newsletter.</p>
